							The aim of this project is to study the word “logic” in five different languages.<br>

                        <p><h2>This project was carried out as part of the supervised project course in the first semester of the master's degree in Natural language processing(NLP).</h2></p><br>
                        <h2>Why the word Logic?</h2><br>
                        <p><h2>
                        Initially, we had planned to focus solely on the study of computational models applied to linguistic data. However, as we explored the underlying
                        underlying theoretical concepts, we realized that the word “Logic” plays a fundamental role in the formalization of linguistic structures,
                        This discovery led us to reorient our project in order to analyze in greater detail the use and conceptualization of the word “Logic”.
                        conceptualization of the word “Logic” in linguistic corpora, while establishing correlations with Natural language processing(NLP) methods.
                        And the world logic has an intresing etymology, which can remote to the discussion between Socrate, Cratyle and Hermogene about the noun's justice. The word logic is derived from logos which means gods or all the world. And the revolution of a oral society to a literate society, one of the piste, is how people think about fairy tales and in the ancient times, oral societies were based on fairy tales in which, the word logos were powerful.
                        <h2></p><br>

					<h1>Language selection</h1><br>
					<p><h2>We decided to study the use of the word “Logic” in English, Arabic, Chinese, French and Portuguese, because the word “logic”, although universally recognized, is tinged with the cultural and linguistic particularities of each language. This richness allows us to explore its implications in a variety of contexts, from philosophy to concrete NLP applications. Our project thus aims to demonstrate how a universal concept can be reconfigured by cultures and enrich modern linguistic approaches.</h2></p><br>
					<p><h2>In English, the term logic is strongly associated with disciplinary fields such as mathematics, computer science and analytic philosophy. The main implication lies in its role as the basis for formal reasoning and algorithmic decision-making. In artificial intelligence, for example, logic is a mainstay of expert systems and knowledge representation. And we will see in the furtur analyses that how the contextes can change the behavior usage of the world cross through different countries.
