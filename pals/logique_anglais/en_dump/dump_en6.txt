1 Introduction

   The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) Working Group was chartered by the
   World Wide Web Consortium in 2005 to create a standard for exchanging
   rules among rule systems, in particular among Web rule engines. RIF
   focused on exchange rather than trying to develop a single one-fits-all
   rule language because, in contrast to other Semantic Web standards,
   such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, it was immediately clear that a single
   language would not satisfy the needs of many popular paradigms for
   using rules in knowledge representation and business modeling. But even
   rule exchange alone was recognized as a daunting task. Known rule
   systems fall into three broad categories: first-order,
   logic-programming, and action rules. These paradigms share little in
   the way of syntax and semantics. Moreover, there are large differences
   between systems even within the same paradigm.

   Given this diversity, what is the most useful notion of rule exchange?
   The approach taken by the Working Group was to design a family of
   languages, called dialects, with rigorously specified syntax and
   semantics. The family of RIF dialects is intended to be uniform and
   extensible. RIF uniformity means that dialects are expected to share as
   much as possible of the existing syntactic and semantic apparatus.
   Extensibility here means that it should be possible for motivated
   experts to define a new RIF dialect as a syntactic extension to an
   existing RIF dialect, with new elements corresponding to desired
   additional functionality. These new RIF dialects would be non-standard
   when defined, but might eventually become standards.

   Because of the emphasis on rigor, the word format in the name of RIF is
   somewhat of an understatement. RIF in fact provides more than just a
   format. However, the concept of format is essential to the way RIF is
   intended to be used. Ultimately, the medium of exchange between
   different rule systems is XML, a format for data exchange. Central to
   the idea behind rule exchange through RIF is that different systems
   will provide syntactic mappings from their native languages to RIF
   dialects and back. These mappings are required to be
   semantics-preserving, and thus rule sets can be communicated from one
   system to another provided that the systems can talk through a suitable
   dialect, which they both support.

2 RIF Dialects

   The RIF Working Group has focused on two kinds of dialects: logic-based
   dialects and dialects for rules with actions. Generally, logic-based
   dialects include languages that employ some kind of logic, such as
   first-order logic (often restricted to Horn logic) or non-first-order
   logics underlying the various logic programming languages (e.g., logic
   programming under the well-founded or stable semantics). The
   rules-with-actions dialects include production rule systems, such as
   Jess, Drools and JRules, as well as reactive (or
   event-condition-action) rules, such as Reaction RuleML and XChange. Due
   to the limited resources of the RIF Working Group, it defined only two
   logic dialects, the Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) and a subset, the RIF
   Core Dialect, shared with RIF-PRD; the Production Rule Dialect
   (RIF-PRD) is the only rules-with-actions dialect defined by the group.
   Other dialects are expected to be defined by the various user
   communities.

   Present and future RIF dialects are expected to share datatypes,
   built-in functions, and built-in predicates as defined by RIF Datatypes
   and Built-Ins (RIF-DTB). In particular, the current dialects RIF-BLD,
   RIF-Core, and RIF-PRD all share the foundations of RIF-DTB 1.0.

3 RIF Framework for Logic Dialects

   The RIF Working Group spent almost four years on developing the above
   three dialects, and this begs a question: If dialect development is so
   time consuming, who will donate the necessary resources for the next
   round of development and who will ensure the uniformity of
   community-developed dialects once the RIF Working Group disbands? The
   Working Group partially addressed these questions by also developing an
   extensibility framework, called the Framework for Logic Dialects, or
   RIF-FLD. A comparable framework for rules with actions might be
   developed later.

   Developing RIF-FLD as a framework turned out to be feasible because
   despite the diversity of logical theories underlying the different
   logic rule systems, they share much of the same syntactic and semantic
   machinery. Moreover, the ways to combine the different pieces of that
   machinery in order to create those logic systems are well studied.
   However, the RIF-FLD specification is unique in that it digests much of
   this knowledge, presents it in a coherent form, and uses XML even on
   the framework level.

   RIF-FLD is a very general logic language that includes a great deal of
   commonly used syntactic and semantic apparatus; however, it purposely
   leaves certain parameters unspecified to enable designers of concrete
   dialects to fill in the necessary details. For instance, RIF-FLD
   provides machinery to tweak the rules of syntax through the notion of
   signatures. It also specifies certain semantic notions, such as models
   and logical entailment, but it leaves certain other options open (for
   instance, which exact models are to be used for entailment). A dialect
   designer can then define the syntax of a dialect by specializing it
   from the syntax of RIF-FLD, and the semantics by specializing it from
   the semantics of RIF-FLD. While doing so, the designer will make
   choices by selecting from the options provided by RIF-FLD, but he or
   she will not have to repeat the definitions of formulas, datatypes,
   models, entailment, and so on. This approach is illustrated using the
   RIF-BLD dialect. This dialect is specified in two ways, both normative:
   directly, by spelling out all the definitions, which takes about 40
   dense pages, and by specialization from RIF-FLD -- just about 5 pages.
   Any discrepancy between the two specifications is to be treated as a
   bug that must be clarified and corrected. This dual specification of
   RIF-BLD is also intended to serve as an example of dialect design by
   specialization from the RIF framework -- the preferred mode of
   specification for various future logic dialects.

   The RIF framework is not a monument that is cut in stone and is likely
   to see several extensions in the future. One, as we already mentioned,
   might be to cover the paradigm of actions and reactive rules.

4 RDF and OWL Compatibility

   Recognizing that RIF rules should be able to interface with RDF and OWL
   ontologies, the RIF Working Group has also defined the necessary
   concepts to ensure compatibility of RIF with RDF and OWL. RIF, RDF, and
   OWL are exchange languages with dissimilar syntaxes and semantics. How,
   then, should RIF rules refer to RDF and OWL facts, and what is the
   logical meaning of the overall language? RIF-RDF and OWL Compatibility
   defines just that. The basic idea is that RIF uses its frame syntax to
   communicate with RDF/OWL. These frames are mapped onto RDF triples and
   a joint semantics is defined for the combination.

5 A General Survey of the RIF Documents

   Besides this Overview, the RIF Working Group has produced twelve
   documents, six of which have become W3C Recommendations. The following
   general survey can help the reader to navigate these documents.
     * RIF Primer. The Primer is a self-contained informal introduction to
       RIF, developing simple rule examples over movie data.

     * RIF-BLD: The Basic Logic Dialect. This is one of the two major
       dialects, and the main logic-based dialect, developed by the group.
       Technically, this dialect corresponds to Horn logic with various
       syntactic and semantic extensions. The main syntactic extensions
       include the frame syntax and predicates with named arguments. The
       main semantic extensions include datatypes and externally defined
       predicates. Although this dialect is not expressive enough for many
       applications of rules, it covers many existing rule systems, and
       development of such a dialect was necessary as a starting point for
       future, more expressive dialects. This future activity is expected
       to take place within the RIF extensibility framework, RIF-FLD.

     * RIF-PRD: The Production Rule Dialect. This is the other major
       dialect developed by the group, capturing the main aspects of
       various production rule systems. Serious industrial interest in
       production rule technology has been demonstrated by major players.
       Production rules, as they are currently practiced in main-stream
       systems like Jess or JRules, are defined using ad hoc computational
       mechanisms, which are not based on a logic. For this reason,
       RIF-PRD is not part of the suite of logical RIF dialects and stands
       apart from them. However, significant effort has been extended to
       ensure as much sharing with the other dialects as possible. This
       sharing was the main reason for the development of the RIF Core
       dialect.

     * RIF-Core: The Core Dialect. This dialect is a subset of both
       RIF-BLD and RIF-PRD based on RIF-DTB 1.0, thus enabling limited
       rule exchange between logic rule dialects and production rules.
       RIF-Core corresponds to Horn logic without function symbols (often
       called 'Datalog') with a number of extensions to support features
       such as objects and frames as in F-logic, internationalized
       resource identifiers for concepts, and XML Schema datatypes.

     * RIF-FLD: The Framework for Logic Dialects. RIF-FLD is not a dialect
       in its own right, but rather a general logical extensibility
       framework. It was introduced in order to drastically lower the
       amount of effort needed to define and verify new logic dialects
       that extend the capabilities of RIF-BLD.

     * RIF-RDF+OWL: RDF and OWL Compatibility. Rules interchanged via RIF
       may depend on or be used in combination with RDF data and RDF
       Schema or OWL ontologies. This document enables interoperability
       between RIF and these other Semantic Web standards. It defines the
       syntax and semantics of combined RIF+RDF and RIF+OWL 2 languages.

     * RIF-DTB: Datatypes and Built-ins. Rules often refer to built-ins
       (e.g., arithmetics, string manipulation) and datatypes (e.g.,
       integers, strings, Booleans). To enable semantics-preserving
       exchange of such rules, it is necessary that most commonly used
       datatypes and built-in functions and predicates are identified and
       their semantics are defined precisely. This purpose is served by
       the RIF-DTB document.

     * RIF+XML-Data: RIF Combination with XML Data. Rules should be
       combinable with XML data sources. This document specifies how such
       combinations can be done.

     * RIF-OWLRL: OWL 2 RL in RIF. OWL 2 RL is an OWL 2 subset defined via
       a partial axiomatization of the OWL 2 RDF-based semantics in the
       form of implications. That definition can be used as the basis for
       a rule-based implementation as shown in this document using RIF.

     * RIF in RDF. Although the standard exchange syntax for RIF is XML,
       as defined in the dialect specifications, it is possible to map
       this XML to RDF graphs, so that RDF systems can more easily store
       and process RIF documents. Since RDF is compatible with RIF frames
       (see RIF RDF and OWL Compatibility), this mapping also provides an
       interoperable way to write RIF rules that process RIF documents.

     * RIF-UCR: Use Cases and Requirements. One of the first tasks of the
       RIF Working Group was to identify classes of applications that the
       RIF suite of dialects should be able to address, and use that to
       derive requirements to RIF. To a large extent, the design of RIF
       dialects was driven by the requirements found in the RIF-UCR
       document.

     * RIF-Test: Test Cases. This document is primarily of concern to RIF
       implementers. It includes the description of test cases -- both
       positive and negative -- that can be used in order to give an
       indication of whether a particular implementation of a RIF dialect
       is compliant with the specifications. There is a companion
       repository of the source code for the various test cases.
