   Logical reasoning is concerned with the correctness of arguments. A key
   distinction is between deductive and non-deductive arguments.

   Logical reasoning is a mental activity that aims to arrive at a
   conclusion in a rigorous way. It happens in the form of inferences or
   arguments by starting from a set of premises and reasoning to a
   conclusion supported by these premises. The premises and the conclusion
   are propositions, i.e. true or false claims about what is the case.
   Together, they form an argument. Logical reasoning is norm-governed in
   the sense that it aims to formulate correct arguments that any rational
   person would find convincing. The main discipline studying logical
   reasoning is logic.

   Distinct types of logical reasoning differ from each other concerning
   the norms they employ and the certainty of the conclusion they arrive
   at. Deductive reasoning offers the strongest support: the premises
   ensure the conclusion, meaning that it is impossible for the conclusion
   to be false if all the premises are true. Such an argument is called a
   valid argument, for example: all men are mortal; Socrates is a man;
   therefore, Socrates is mortal. For valid arguments, it is not important
   whether the premises are actually true but only that, if they were
   true, the conclusion could not be false. Valid arguments follow a rule
   of inference, such as modus ponens or modus tollens. Deductive
   reasoning plays a central role in formal logic and mathematics.

   For non-deductive logical reasoning, the premises make their conclusion
   rationally convincing without ensuring its truth. This is often
   understood in terms of probability: the premises make it more likely
   that the conclusion is true and strong inferences make it very likely.
   Some uncertainty remains because the conclusion introduces new
   information not already found in the premises. Non-deductive reasoning
   plays a central role in everyday life and in most sciences.
   Often-discussed types are inductive, abductive, and analogical
   reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a form of generalization that infers
   a universal law from a pattern found in many individual cases. It can
   be used to conclude that "all ravens are black" based on many
   individual observations of black ravens. Abductive reasoning, also
   known as "inference to the best explanation", starts from an
   observation and reasons to the fact explaining this observation. An
   example is a doctor who examines the symptoms of their patient to make
   a diagnosis of the underlying cause. Analogical reasoning compares two
   similar systems. It observes that one of them has a feature and
   concludes that the other one also has this feature.

   Arguments that fall short of the standards of logical reasoning are
   called fallacies. For formal fallacies, like affirming the consequent,
   the error lies in the logical form of the argument. For informal
   fallacies, like false dilemmas, the source of the faulty reasoning is
   usually found in the content or the context of the argument. Some
   theorists understand logical reasoning in a wide sense that is roughly
   equivalent to critical thinking. In this regard, it encompasses
   cognitive skills besides the ability to draw conclusions from premises.
   Examples are skills to generate and evaluate reasons and to assess the
   reliability of information. Further factors are to seek new
   information, to avoid inconsistencies, and to consider the advantages
   and disadvantages of different courses of action before making a
   decision.

Definition

   [edit]

   Logical reasoning is a form of thinking that is concerned with arriving
   at a conclusion in a rigorous way.^[1] This happens in the form of
   inferences by transforming the information present in a set of premises
   to reach a conclusion.^[2]^[3] It can be defined as "selecting and
   interpreting information from a given context, making connections, and
   verifying and drawing conclusions based on provided and interpreted
   information and the associated rules and processes."^[4] Logical
   reasoning is rigorous in the sense that it does not generate any
   conclusion but ensures that the premises support the conclusion and act
   as reasons for believing it.^[5]^[6] One central aspect is that this
   support is not restricted to a specific reasoner but that any rational
   person would find the conclusion convincing based on the
   premises.^[6]^[1] This way, logical reasoning plays a role in expanding
   knowledge.^[7]

   The main discipline studying logical reasoning is called logic. It is
   divided into formal and informal logic, which study formal and informal
   logical reasoning.^[8]^[9]^[10] Traditionally, logical reasoning was
   primarily associated with deductive reasoning studied by formal
   logic.^[11] But in a wider sense, it also includes forms of
   non-deductive reasoning, such as inductive, abductive, and analogical
   reasoning.^[12]^[13]^[14]

   The forms of logical reasoning have in common that they use premises to
   make inferences in a norm-governed way. As norm-governed practices,
   they aim at inter-subjective agreement about the application of the
   norms, i.e. agreement about whether and to what degree the premises
   support their conclusion. The types of logical reasoning differ
   concerning the exact norms they use as well as the certainty of the
   conclusion they arrive at.^[1]^[15] Deductive reasoning offers the
   strongest support and implies its conclusion with certainty, like
   mathematical proofs. For non-deductive reasoning, the premises make the
   conclusion more likely but do not ensure it. This support comes in
   degrees: strong arguments make the conclusion very likely, as is the
   case for well-researched issues in the empirical sciences.^[1]^[16]
   Some theorists give a very wide definition of logical reasoning that
   includes its role as a cognitive skill responsible for high-quality
   thinking. In this regard, it has roughly the same meaning as critical
   thinking.^[13]^[17]

Basic concepts

   [edit]

   A variety of basic concepts is used in the study and analysis of
   logical reasoning. Logical reasoning happens by inferring a conclusion
   from a set of premises.^[3] Premises and conclusions are normally seen
   as propositions. A proposition is a statement that makes a claim about
   what is the case. In this regard, propositions act as truth-bearers:
   they are either true or false.^[18]^[19]^[3] For example, the sentence
   "The water is boiling." expresses a proposition since it can be true or
   false. The sentences "Is the water boiling?" or "Boil the water!", on
   the other hand, express no propositions since they are neither true nor
   false.^[20]^[3] The propositions used as the starting point of logical
   reasoning are called the premises. The proposition inferred from them
   is called the conclusion.^[18]^[19] For example, in the argument "all
   puppies are dogs; all dogs are animals; therefore all puppies are
   animals", the propositions "all puppies are dogs" and "all dogs are
   animals" act as premises while the proposition "all puppies are
   animals" is the conclusion.^[21]^[22]

   A set of premises together with a conclusion is called an
   argument.^[23]^[3] An inference is the mental process of reasoning that
   starts from the premises and arrives at the conclusion.^[18]^[24] But
   the terms "argument" and "inference" are often used interchangeably in
   logic. The purpose of arguments is to convince a person that something
   is the case by providing reasons for this belief.^[25]^[26] Many
   arguments in natural language do not explicitly state all the premises.
   Instead, the premises are often implicitly assumed, especially if they
   seem obvious and belong to common sense.^[25]^[27] Some theorists
   distinguish between simple and complex arguments. A complex argument is
   made up of many sub-arguments. This way, a chain is formed in which the
   conclusions of earlier arguments act as premises for later arguments.
   Each link in this chain has to be successful for a complex argument to
   succeed.^[18]^[25]

   An argument is correct or incorrect depending on whether the premises
   offer support for the conclusion. This is often understood in terms of
   probability: if the premises of a correct argument are true, it raises
   the probability that its conclusion is also true. Forms of logical
   reasoning can be distinguished based on how the premises support the
   conclusion. Deductive arguments offer the strongest possible support.
   Non-deductive arguments are weaker but are nonetheless correct forms of
   reasoning.^[28]^[29] The term "proof" is often used for deductive
   arguments or very strong non-deductive arguments.^[30] Incorrect
   arguments offer no or not sufficient support and are called
   fallacies,^[31]^[32] although the use of incorrect arguments does not
   mean their conclusions are incorrect.^[33]

Deductive reasoning

   [edit]
   Main article: Deductive reasoning

   Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive
   inferences. Deductively valid inferences are the most reliable form of
   inference: it is impossible for their conclusion to be false if all the
   premises are true.^[34]^[35] This means that the truth of the premises
   ensures the truth of the conclusion. A deductive argument is sound if
   it is valid and all its premises are true.^[36] For example, inferring
   the conclusion "no cats are frogs" from the premises "all frogs are
   amphibians" and "no cats are amphibians" is a sound argument. But even
   arguments with false premises can be deductively valid, like inferring
   that "no cats are frogs" from the premises "all frogs are mammals" and
   "no cats are mammals". In this regard, it only matters that the
   conclusion could not be false if the premises are true and not whether
   they actually are true.^[37]

   Deductively valid arguments follow a rule of inference.^[38] A rule of
   inference is a scheme of drawing conclusions that depends only on the
   logical form of the premises and the conclusion but not on their
   specific content.^[39]^[40] The most-discussed rule of inference is the
   modus ponens. It has the following form: p; if p then q; therefore q.
   This scheme is deductively valid no matter what p and q stand
   for.^[41]^[5] For example, the argument "today is Sunday; if today is
   Sunday then I don't have to go to work today; therefore I don't have to
   go to work today" is deductively valid because it has the form of modus
   ponens.^[42] Other popular rules of inference include modus tollens
   (not q; if p then q; therefore not p) and the disjunctive syllogism (p
   or q; not p; therefore q).^[42]^[43]

   The rules governing deductive reasoning are often expressed formally as
   logical systems for assessing the correctness of deductive arguments.
   Aristotelian logic is one of the earliest systems and was treated as
   the canon of logic in the Western world for over two thousand years. It
   is based on syllogisms, like concluding that "Socrates is a mortal"
   from the premises "Socrates is a man" and "all men are
   mortal".^[44]^[45]^[46] The currently dominant system is known as
   classical logic and covers many additional forms of inferences besides
   syllogisms. So-called extended logics are based on classical logic and
   introduce additional rules of inference for specific domains. For
   example, modal logic can be used to reason about what is possible and
   what is necessary. Temporal logic can be used to draw inferences about
   what happened before, during, and after an event.^[47]^[48]^[49]
   Classical logic and its extensions rest on a set of basic logical
   intuitions accepted by most logicians. They include the law of excluded
   middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of explosion,
   and the bivalence of truth.^[50] So-called deviant logics reject some
   of these basic intuitions and propose alternative rules governing the
   validity of arguments.^[44]^[51]^[52] For example, intuitionistic
   logics reject the law of excluded middle and the double negation
   elimination while paraconsistent logics reject the principle of
   explosion.^[52]^[53]^[54]

   Deductive reasoning plays a central role in formal logic and
   mathematics.^[1] In mathematics, it is used to prove mathematical
   theorems based on a set of premises, usually called axioms. For
   example, Peano arithmetic is based on a small set of axioms from which
   all essential properties of natural numbers can be inferred using
   deductive reasoning.^[55]^[56]

Non-deductive reasoning

   [edit]

   Non-deductive reasoning is an important form of logical reasoning
   besides deductive reasoning. It happens in the form of inferences drawn
   from premises to reach and support a conclusion, just like its
   deductive counterpart. The hallmark of non-deductive reasoning is that
   this support is fallible. This means that if the premises are true, it
   makes it more likely but not certain that the conclusion is also
   true.^[57]^[58] So for a non-deductive argument, it is possible for all
   its premises to be true while its conclusion is still false. There are
   various types of non-deductive reasoning, like inductive, abductive,
   and analogical reasoning.^[1]^[59] Non-deductive reasoning is more
   common in everyday life than deductive reasoning.^[60]

   Non-deductive reasoning is ampliative and defeasible.^[61]^[62]
   Sometimes, the terms non-deductive reasoning, ampliative reasoning, and
   defeasible reasoning are used synonymously even though there are slight
   differences in their meaning. Non-deductive reasoning is ampliative in
   the sense that it arrives at information not already present in the
   premises. Deductive reasoning, by contrast, is non-ampliative since it
   only extracts information already present in the premises without
   adding any additional information.^[62]^[63]^[59] So with non-deductive
   reasoning, one can learn something new that one did not know before.
   But the fact that new information is added means that this additional
   information may be false. This is why non-deductive reasoning is not as
   secure as deductive reasoning.^[58]^[64]

   A closely related aspect is that non-deductive reasoning is defeasible
   or non-monotonic. This means that one may have to withdraw a conclusion
   upon learning new information. For example, if all birds a person has
   seen so far can fly, this person is justified in reaching the inductive
   conclusion that all birds fly. This conclusion is defeasible because
   the reasoner may have to revise it upon learning that penguins are
   birds that do not fly.^[65]^[66]^[67]

Inductive

   [edit]
   Main article: Inductive reasoning
   Photo of an Australian raven Based on many individual observations of
   black ravens, inductive reasoning can be used to infer that all ravens
   are black.

   Inductive reasoning starts from a set of individual instances and uses
   generalization to arrive at a universal law governing all
   cases.^[68]^[69]^[70] Some theorists use the term in a very wide sense
   to include any form of non-deductive reasoning, even if no
   generalization is involved.^[69]^[71]^[68] In the more narrow sense, it
   can be defined as "the process of inferring a general law or principle
   from the observations of particular instances."^[68] For example,
   starting from the empirical observation that "all ravens I have seen so
   far are black", inductive reasoning can be used to infer that "all
   ravens are black". In a slightly weaker form, induction can also be
   used to infer an individual conclusion about a single case, for
   example, that "the next raven I will see is black".^[69]^[1] Inductive
   reasoning is closely related to statistical reasoning and probabilistic
   reasoning.^[72] Like other forms of non-deductive reasoning, induction
   is not certain. This means that the premises support the conclusion by
   making it more probable but do not ensure its truth. In this regard,
   the conclusion of an inductive inference contains new information not
   already found in the premises.^[68]^[60]^[1]

   Various aspects of the premises are important to ensure that they offer
   significant support to the conclusion. In this regard, the sample size
   should be large to guarantee that many individual cases were considered
   before drawing the conclusion.^[60]^[73] An intimately connected factor
   is that the sample is random and representative. This means that it
   includes a fair and balanced selection of individuals with different
   key characteristics. For example, when making a generalization about
   human beings, the sample should include members of different races,
   genders, and age groups.^[60]^[74]^[75] A lot of reasoning in everyday
   life is inductive. For example, when predicting how a person will react
   to a situation, inductive reasoning can be employed based on how the
   person reacted previously in similar circumstances. It plays an equally
   central role in the sciences, which often start with many particular
   observations and then apply the process of generalization to arrive at
   a universal law.^[76]^[77]^[1]

   A well-known issue in the field of inductive reasoning is the so-called
   problem of induction. It concerns the question of whether or why anyone
   is justified in believing the conclusions of inductive inferences. This
   problem was initially raised by David Hume, who holds that future
   events need not resemble past observations. In this regard, inductive
   reasoning about future events seems to rest on the assumption that
   nature remains uniform.^[78]^[79]

Abductive

   [edit]
   Main article: Abductive reasoning

   Abductive reasoning is usually understood as an inference from an
   observation to a fact explaining this observation. Inferring that it
   has rained after seeing that the streets are wet is one example. Often,
   the expression "inference to the best explanation" is used as a
   synonym.^[80]^[81]^[1] This expression underlines that there are
   usually many possible explanations of the same fact and that the
   reasoner should only infer the best explanation. For example, a tsunami
   could also explain why the streets are wet but this is usually not the
   best explanation. As a form of non-deductive reasoning, abduction does
   not guarantee the truth of the conclusion even if the premises are
   true.^[80]^[82]

   The more plausible the explanation is, the stronger it is supported by
   the premises. In this regard, it matters that the explanation is
   simple, i.e. does not include any unnecessary claims, and that it is
   consistent with established knowledge.^[83]^[81]^[84] Other central
   criteria for a good explanation are that it fits observed and commonly
   known facts and that it is relevant, precise, and not circular.
   Ideally, the explanation should be verifiable by empirical evidence. If
   the explanation involves extraordinary claims then it requires very
   strong evidence.^[84]
   Photo of a medical examination Doctors use abductive reasoning when
   investigating the symptoms of a patient to determine their underlying
   cause.

   Abductive reasoning plays a central role in science when researchers
   discover unexplained phenomena. In this case, they often resort to a
   form of guessing to come up with general principles that could explain
   the observations. The hypotheses are then tested and compared to
   discover which one provides the best explanation.^[85]^[84] This
   pertains particularly to cases of causal reasoning that try to discover
   the relation between causes and effects.^[84] Abduction is also very
   common in everyday life. It is used there in a similar but less
   systematic form.^[85]^[84] This relates, for example, to the trust
   people put in what other people say. The best explanation of why a
   person asserts a claim is usually that they believe it and have
   evidence for it. This form of abductive reasoning is relevant to why
   one normally trusts what other people say even though this inference is
   usually not drawn in an explicit way. Something similar happens when
   the speaker's statement is ambiguous and the audience tries to discover
   and explain what the speaker could have meant.^[85] Abductive reasoning
   is also common in medicine when a doctor examines the symptoms of their
   patient in order to arrive at a diagnosis of their underlying
   cause.^[1]

Analogical

   [edit]
   Photo of a Zucker rat Analogical reasoning can be used to transfer
   insights from animal experiments to humans, like in the case of
   research on obesity and hypertension performed on Zucker
   rats.^[86]^[87]

   Analogical reasoning involves the comparison of two systems in relation
   to their similarity. It starts from information about one system and
   infers information about another system based on the resemblance
   between the two systems.^[88]^[89] Expressed schematically, arguments
   from analogy have the following form: (1) a is similar to b; (2) a has
   feature F; (3) therefore b probably also has feature F.^[89]^[90]
   Analogical reasoning can be used, for example, to infer information
   about humans from medical experiments on animals: (1) rats are similar
   to humans; (2) birth control pills affect the brain development of
   rats; (3) therefore they may also affect the brain development of
   humans.^[86]

   Through analogical reasoning, knowledge can be transferred from one
   situation or domain to another. Arguments from analogy provide support
   for their conclusion but do not guarantee its truth. Their strength
   depends on various factors. The more similar the systems are, the more
   likely it is that a given feature of one object also characterizes the
   other object. Another factor concerns not just the degree of similarity
   but also its relevance. For example, an artificial strawberry made of
   plastic may be similar to a real strawberry in many respects, including
   its shape, color, and surface structure. But these similarities are
   irrelevant to whether the artificial strawberry tastes as sweet as the
   real one.^[91]

   Analogical reasoning plays a central role in problem-solving,
   decision-making, and learning. It can be used both for simple physical
   characteristics and complex abstract ideas.^[92]^[93] In science,
   analogies are often used in models to understand complex phenomena in a
   simple way. For example, the Bohr model explains the interactions of
   sub-atomic particles in analogy to how planets revolve around the
   sun.^[94]^[95]

Fallacies

   [edit]
   Main article: Fallacy

   A fallacy is an incorrect argument or a faulty form of reasoning. This
   means that the premises provide no or not sufficient support for the
   conclusion. Fallacies often appear to be correct on the first
   impression and thereby seduce people into accepting and using them. In
   logic, the term "fallacy" does not mean that the conclusion is false.
   Instead, it only means that some kind of error was committed on the way
   to reaching the conclusion. An argument can be a fallacy even if, by a
   fortuitous accident, the conclusion is true. Outside the field of
   logic, the term "fallacy" is sometimes used in a slightly different
   sense for a false belief or theory and not for an
   argument.^[32]^[96]^[97]

   Fallacies are usually divided into formal and informal fallacies.
   Formal fallacies are expressed in a formal language and usually belong
   to deductive reasoning. Their fault lies in the logical form of the
   argument, i.e. that it does not follow a valid rule of
   inference.^[98]^[99] A well-known formal fallacy is affirming the
   consequent. It has the following form: (1) q; (2) if p then q; (3)
   therefore p. This fallacy is committed, for example, when a person
   argues that "the burglars entered by the front door" based on the
   premises "the burglars forced the lock" and "if the burglars entered by
   the front door, then they forced the lock".^[100] This fallacy is
   similar to the valid rule of inference known as modus ponens. It is
   faulty because the first premise and the conclusion are switched
   around. Other well-known formal fallacies are denying the antecedent,
   affirming a disjunct, denying a conjunct, and the fallacy of the
   undistributed middle.^[32]^[96]^[101]

   Informal fallacies are expressed in natural language. Their main fault
   usually lies not in the form of the argument but has other sources,
   like its content or context.^[96]^[99] Some informal fallacies, like
   some instances of false dilemmas and strawman fallacies, even involve
   correct deductive reasoning on the formal level.^[97] The content of an
   argument is the idea that is expressed in it. For example, a false
   dilemma is an informal fallacy that is based on an error in one of the
   premises. The faulty premise oversimplifies reality: it states that
   things are either one way or another way but ignore many other viable
   alternatives.^[102]^[103] False dilemmas are often used by politicians
   when they claim that either their proposal is accepted or there will be
   dire consequences. Such claims usually ignore that various alternatives
   exist to avoid those consequences, i.e. that their proposal is not the
   only viable solution.^[104]

   The strawman fallacy is another informal fallacy. Its error happens on
   the level of the context. It consists in misrepresenting the view of an
   opponent and then refuting this view. The refutation itself is often
   correct but the error lies in the false assumption that the opponent
   actually defends this view. For example, an alcohol lobbyist may
   respond to the suggestion to ban alcohol advertisements on television
   by claiming that it is impossible to make people give up drinking
   alcohol. This is a strawman fallacy since the suggestion was merely to
   ban advertisements and not to stop all alcohol
   consumption.^[105]^[96]^[106]

   Ambiguous and vague expressions in natural language are often
   responsible for the faulty reasoning in informal fallacies. For
   example, this is the case for fallacies of ambiguity, like the argument
   "(1) feathers are light; (2) light is opposed to darkness; (3)
   therefore feathers are opposed to darkness". The error is found in the
   ambiguous term "light", which has one meaning in the first premise
   ("not heavy") and a different meaning in the second premise ("visible
   electromagnetic radiation").^[107]^[108]^[109]

As a skill

   [edit]

   Some theorists discuss logical reasoning in a very wide sense that
   includes its role as a broad skill responsible for high-quality
   thinking. In this sense, it is roughly equivalent to critical thinking
   and includes the capacity to select and apply the appropriate rules of
   logic to specific situations.^[110] It encompasses a great variety of
   abilities besides drawing conclusions from premises. Examples are to
   understand a position, to generate and evaluate reasons for and against
   it as well as to critically assess whether to accept or reject certain
   information. It is about making judgments and drawing conclusions after
   careful evaluation and contrasts in this regard with uncritical snap
   judgments and gut feelings.^[17] Other core skills linked to logical
   reasoning are to assess reasons before accepting a claim and to search
   for new information if more is needed to reach a reliable conclusion.
   It also includes the ability to consider different courses of action
   and compare the advantages and disadvantages of their consequences, to
   use common sense, and to avoid inconsistencies.^[111]^[112] The skills
   responsible for logical reasoning can be learned, trained, and
   improved.^[17]^[113]

   Logical reasoning is relevant both on the theoretical and practical
   level.^[114]^[115] On the theoretical level, it helps decrease the
   number of false beliefs. A central aspect concerns the abilities used
   to distinguish facts from mere opinions, like the process of finding
   and evaluating reasons for and against a position to come to one's own
   conclusion.^[114] This includes being able to differentiate between
   reliable and unreliable sources of information. This matters for
   effective reasoning since it is often necessary to rely on information
   provided by other people instead of checking every single fact for
   oneself. ^[116]^[117] This way, logical reasoning can help the person
   avoid the effects of propaganda or being manipulated by
   others.^[118]^[119] When important information is missing, it is often
   better to suspend judgment than to jump to conclusions.^[118] In this
   regard, logical reasoning should be skeptical and open-minded at the
   same time.^[120]

   On the practical level, logical reasoning concerns the issue of making
   rational and effective decisions.^[114]^[115] For many real-life
   decisions, various courses of action are available to the agent. For
   each possible action, there can be conflicting reasons, some in favor
   of it and others opposed to it. In such cases, logical reasoning
   includes weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks as well as
   considering their likelihood in order to arrive at a balanced
   all-things-considered decision.^[121]^[122] For example, when a person
   runs out of drinking water in the middle of a hiking trip, they could
   employ the skills associated with logical reasoning to decide whether
   to boil and drink water from a stream that might contain dangerous
   microorganisms rather than break off the trip and hike back to the
   parking lot. This could include considering factors like assessing how
   dangerous the microorganisms are and the likelihood that they survive
   the boiling procedure. It may also involve gathering relevant
   information to make these assessments, for example, by asking other
   hikers.^[123]

   Time also plays a central role in logical reasoning.^[124] If one lacks
   important information, it is often better to delay a decision and look
   for new information before coming to a conclusion.^[111] If the
   decision is time-sensitive, on the other hand, logical reasoning may
   imply making a fast decision based on the currently available evidence
   even if it is very limited. For example, if a friend yells "Duck!"
   during a baseball game the most logical response may be to blindly
   trust them and duck instead of demanding an explanation or
   investigating what might have prompted their exclamation.^[124]^[125]
   Generally speaking, the less time there is, the more significant it is
   to trust intuitions and gut feelings. If there is more time, on the
   other hand, it becomes important to examine ambiguities and assess
   contradictory information.^[126]
