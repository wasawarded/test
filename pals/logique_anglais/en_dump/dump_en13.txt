   An electromechanical engineering degree that explores the fundamentals
   of mechatronics, which involves the integration of mechanics,
   electrical circuits, microprocessors, mathematics, materials
   technology, computer-aided engineering, and design.
     __________________________________________________________________

Overview for Electrical Mechanical Engineering Technology BS

   This program is no longer accepting new student applications.

   Students interested in electronics, mechanical systems, computers,
   imaging and sensing, automation, and robotics are encouraged to
   consider the mechatronics engineering technology BS program.

   With the increased complexity of products and production design, which
   includes the integration of software, electronics with mechanical and
   electrical components (mechatronics), there is a growing need for
   professionals who have a strong foundation in the electrical,
   mechanical, programming and manufacturing disciplines. The electrical
   mechanical engineering technology major prepares students for careers
   in engineering disciplines where the integration of mechanical,
   electrical, programming and manufacturing disciplines is important.
   Students develop skills that explore the fundamentals of mechanics,
   electrical circuits, and microprocessors, mathematics, materials
   technology, computer-aided engineering, and design. The
   electromechanical engineering major will develop well-rounded
   electrical mechanical engineers as lifelong learners with the ability
   to adapt, grow, and succeed in mechatronics, electromechanical
   engineering environment, or similar highly competitive workplaces.

   With both the increased complexity of product design and the merger of
   mechanical and electrical aspects of design, there is a growing need
   for professionals who have a strong foundation in the electrical,
   mechanical, and manufacturing disciplines. Graduates from the
   electrical mechanical engineering technology program are able to
   effectively bridge the gap between coworkers with more specialized
   backgrounds.

   The electromechanical engineering degree prepares graduates for
   professional careers in the broad field of engineering technology,
   where the integration of mechanical, electrical, and manufacturing
   disciplines is important. We also provide the maximum amount of
   flexibility in transfer from other RIT programs and a variety of
   two-year programs, including engineering science and engineering
   technology.

What You'll Study

   Students develop skills in courses that explore the fundamentals of
   mechanics, electrical circuits, and microprocessors, mathematics,
   materials technology, computer-aided engineering, and design. Later,
   course work focuses on both mechanical and electrical analysis and
   design. The major includes two technical electives and two free
   electives and includes a substantial amount of laboratory and project
   work. Teamwork, technical writing, and computer use are emphasized
   throughout the curriculum, which includes the presentation of
   industry-relevant team projects.

   The major will develop well-rounded electrical mechanical engineers as
   lifelong learners with the ability to adapt, grow, and succeed in
   mechatronics, electromechanical engineering environment, or similar
   highly competitive workplace. The required cooperative education
   experience prepares students to step into professional positions after
   graduation and be immediately productive in careers focused on
   mechatronics development, electromechanical system design, and
   analysis, alternative energy, or system engineering.

Get Involved

Activities and Professional Organizations

   Students have an opportunity to participate in regional and national
   design competitions such as the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
   BAJA team, SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge team, Formula SAE Racing and
   SAE Formula Electric teams. Students are also encouraged to participate
   in the student chapters of professional societies such as the Institute
   of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Society of
   Mechanical Engineers, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the
   Society of Woman Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers,
   Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Society of Automotive
   Engineers.

   Electrical Machines and Transformers
   Develops the knowledge and ability to analyze and specify motors,
   generators, and transformers for use in systems such as wind turbines
   and electric vehicles. Topics include efficiency, energy conservation,
   power factor, magnetism, electro-magnetic force, fields, armatures,
   commutators, rotors, stators, brushes, starters, controllers, DC
   machines, AC motors, alternators, single phase and three phase dynamos,
   three phase circuits, phasors, transformer properties, isolation,
   efficiency, and voltage regulation. (Prerequisites: (EEET-115 and
   EEET-116) or (EEET-121 and EEET-122) or (EEET-215 and EEET-216) or

   Control Systems
   Develops the knowledge of control system concepts and applies them to
   electromechanical systems. Systems are characterized and modeled using
   linear systems methods, focused with a controls perspective. Impulse
   responses, step responses, and transfer functions are reviewed.
   Principles of stability and damping are developed and applied to the
   specification and design of open and closed loop compensators to
   deliver specific input-output performance. Laboratory exercises are
   designed to illustrate concepts, reinforce analysis and design skills,
   and develop instrumentation techniques associated with the lecture
   topics. Student must register for BOTH the Lecture and Laboratory
   components of this course. (Prerequisites: (MATH-211 or MATH-231) and
   ((CPET-253 or (CPET-251 and CPET-252)) or ((EEET-247 and EEET-248) or
   (CPET-133)) or equivalent courses.) Lab 2, Lecture 3 (Fall, Spring).

   Research Methods
   Understanding research and academic writing are foundational skills for
   all graduate students regardless of degree culmination. This is a
   graduate-level survey course on research design/methods and analysis,
   with the goal of all students becoming better consumers of research,
   and preparing those who choose an empirical research degree culmination
   and future doctoral pursuits. The course provides a broad overview of
   the process and practices of research in applied contexts. Content
   includes principles and techniques of research design, sampling, data
   collection, and analysis including the nature of evidence, types of
   research, defining research questions, sampling techniques, data
   collection, data analysis, issues concerning human subjects and
   research ethics, and challenges associated with conducting research in
   real-world contexts. Research strategies using library sources,
   including academic databases and citation management, are emphasized;
   as are academic writing skills, including adherence to academic style.
   The analysis component of the course provides an understanding of
   statistical methodology used to collect and interpret data found in
   research as well as how to read and interpret data collection
   instruments. Lecture 3 (Fall, Spring).

    Accounting for Decision Makers
   A graduate-level introduction to the use of accounting information by
   decision makers. The focus of the course is on two subject areas: (1)
   financial reporting concepts/issues and the use of general-purpose
   financial statements by internal and external decision makers and (2)
   the development and use of special-purpose financial information
   intended to assist managers in planning and controlling an
   organization's activities. Generally accepted accounting principles and
   issues related to International Financial Reporting Standards are
   considered while studying the first subject area and ethical issues
   impacting accounting are considered throughout. (This class is
   restricted to degree-seeking graduate students or those with permission
   from instructor.) Lecture 3 (Fall, Spring, Summer).
