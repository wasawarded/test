   [armoirie.gif] Royal Speech on 68th Anniversary of the Revolution of
   the King and the People
   8/21/2021
   [SMdiscours21une.jpg&amp;w=400]

   Plots hatched by the enemies of our territorial integrity only enhance
   Moroccans' faith and their resolve to continue defending their homeland
   and its interests.
   HM King Mohammed VI on Friday delivered a speech to the Nation on the
   occasion of the 68th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the
   People.
   Here follows the full text of the royal speech:
   "Praise be to God,
   May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin
   Dear Citizens,
   There is no better occasion to remember the values of loyalty and of
   sacrifice for the sake of the homeland’s freedom and independence than
   the commemoration of the Revolution of the King and the People.
   This is more than just a historical event. It is an ongoing revolution
   which has inspired successive generations, celebrating the same spirit
   of true patriotism and eagerness to defend the homeland, its
   institutions and sacred values.
   This commemoration falls a matter of days before the elections. It also
   coincides with the launch of a new set of projects and reforms that
   will be carried out within the framework of the new development model
   and the national charter for development.
   The upcoming general, regional and local elections will be held on the
   same day, a fact which attests to the vibrancy of the country’s
   democratic experience and the maturity of the Moroccan political
   system.
   Dear Citizens,
   Elections are not an end in themselves. Rather, they are a means to set
   up credible institutions that serve the citizens’ interests and defend
   the nation’s causes.
   I believe a state’s strength comes from institutions and from the unity
   and cohesion of the nation’s components. That is our weapon for the
   defense of our country in times of adversity, crisis or threats.
   This was clearly confirmed by the carefully planned attacks mounted
   recently against Morocco by some countries and organizations known for
   their hostility towards our country.
   Morocco is a target because it is a country steeped in history - it has
   existed for more than twelve centuries, not to mention the nation’s
   longstanding Amazigh history - and it is governed by a citizen-based
   monarchy which has existed for more than four centuries, and which is
   rooted in a solid bond between the throne and the people.
   Morocco is also a target because of the security and stability it
   enjoys; these are invaluable assets, especially in light of the
   upheavals characterizing today’s world.
   Nevertheless, and by the grace of the Almighty, Morocco enjoys a
   sterling reputation and indisputable prestige. It also has a solid
   network of relationships and connections and is a trustworthy, credible
   nation at the regional and international levels.
   Dear Citizens,
   Like some other countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, Morocco is the
   target of deliberate, hostile attacks.
   The enemies of the Kingdom's territorial integrity build their
   positions on ready-made, yet obsolete, premises. They simply do not
   want Morocco to remain free, strong and influential.
   Regrettably, a few countries, especially European ones, which are
   traditional partners, fear for their economic interests, markets and
   spheres of influence in the Maghreb region.
   Some of their leaders fail to understand that the problem does not lie
   in the systems of Maghreb countries, but in their own. These are
   systems which continue to feed on the past and cannot stay abreast of
   new developments.
   Recent months have shown that these countries are facing significant
   inadequacies when it comes to respecting the state’s institutions and
   its basic, traditional functions.
   Therefore, they want us to become like them. And to that end, they
   invoke unfounded pretexts and accuse our national institutions of
   failing to uphold rights and freedoms in order to tarnish their
   reputation and try to undermine the esteem and great respect enjoyed by
   our country.
   They do not want to recognize that the rules of the game have changed -
   that our countries are able to manage their own affairs and use their
   energies and resources for the benefit of their peoples.
   Thus, all possible means - legal and otherwise - have been used, roles
   assigned and tremendous resources leveraged to embroil Morocco in
   problems and disputes with some countries.
   In fact, some reports have really crossed the line. Instead of calling
   for Morocco's efforts for balanced development in the region to be
   supported, they made recommendations to impede Morocco’s progress,
   arguing that its development creates an imbalance among Maghreb
   countries.
   Furthermore, they concocted a full-fledged campaign to distort the
   image of our security institutions and undermine their usefulness and
   effectiveness in preserving Morocco’s security and stability.
   These institutions also provide support and coordinate action at the
   regional and international levels, as acknowledged by a number of those
   countries themselves.
   And since every cloud has a silver lining, the plots hatched by the
   enemies of our territorial integrity only enhance Moroccans' faith and
   their resolve to continue defending their homeland and its interests.
   Whether those parties like it or not, we shall continue on the path we
   have chosen for ourselves, despite the enemies’ exasperation and the
   envy of those who hate us.
   Dear Citizens,
   Some people claim that Morocco is being attacked because it has changed
   its political and strategic direction, or because of the way it is
   handling some diplomatic issues.
   That is simply not the case. Morocco has, indeed, changed, but not in
   the way they want it to. Morocco does not accept that its best
   interests be trampled on. At the same time, my country is keen to have
   strong, constructive and balanced relations, especially with our
   neighbors.
   That same logic is governing our policy today regarding the
   relationship with our neighbor, Spain.
   It is a fact that these relations have recently come up against an
   unprecedented crisis, which shook mutual trust and raised many
   questions as to their future.
   However, we have worked with the Spanish side in a composed, clear and
   responsible way.
   In addition to the traditional immutable values on which these
   relations are based, we are keen, today, to strengthen them, bearing in
   mind the need for a common understanding of the two nations’ interests.
   In this regard, I have personally and directly followed the progress of
   the dialogue and discussions between the two countries.
   Our goal was not merely to overcome this crisis, but to turn the
   situation into an opportunity to reconsider the foundations and
   determinants of these relations.
   With a feeling of optimism, I sincerely look forward to continuing to
   work with the Spanish government and with the Spanish Prime Minister,
   His Excellency Mr. Pedro Sanchez, to usher in a new, unprecedented
   phase in the relations between the two countries, on the basis of
   trust, transparency, mutual respect and the fulfillment of obligations.
   The same commitment is at the center of the partnership and solidarity
   between Morocco and France, and I personally entertain solid relations
   based on friendship and mutual esteem with the French President, His
   Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Macron.
   Dear Citizens,
   The Revolution of the King and the People was a watershed in Morocco’s
   struggle to achieve freedom and independence. Today, we are on the
   verge of a new phase, which requires commitment to the spirit of true
   patriotism in order to rise to internal and external challenges.
   I should like to take this opportunity to honor the memory of the
   nation’s valiant martyrs, particularly the hero of the liberation, my
   venerable grandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, and his companion
   in the struggle, my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II – may
   they rest in peace.
   Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh."
