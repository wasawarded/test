I would like to write a paper in logic but I do not know where to start.

   I have sufficient knowledge on the applications of logic. However, I
   have no idea how to write a paper in logic. In academic classes and
   most of other resources online, you would be taught how to apply logic.
   I have never seen a logic class (not a philosophy of logic class) where
   the professor requires her students to write papers because the course
   is concentrated on the understanding and application of logic.

   I want to write a paper in logic. I would like to know where to start.
   Can someone guide me on what research topics should I look into or what
   problems should I try to tackle?

   Thank you in advance!

   EDIT: I might have not been quite clear. I know a lot about logic
   including advanced propositional and predicate logic, modal logic, free
   logic, discrete mathematics, Gödel's incompleteness...etc. I know how
   to solve problems and do proofs, but I am not sure how to write a paper
   on the subject. I can only write papers on truth and meaning which
   could be considered as philosophy of logic and philosophy of language,
   but I am not sure what a logic paper would look like.
