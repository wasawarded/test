Conference Report: Music, Medievalism, and Modernism, 27-28 June 2018,
Huddersfield

   Posted on 29 Oct 2018

   It is a sort of common wisdom for us to say that the past ought to
   inform the future. Lest, of course, we be—as the now somewhat cliché
   Santayana quote would warn us—condemned to repeat it ad infinitum. But
   would that necessarily be such a bad thing? And at the very least,
   might we (or someone) even find it aesthetically, perhaps even
   politically or socially, desirable to visit, reimagine, or
   instrumentalise the past (or the aura, say, of pastness more
   generally)?

   That abovementioned cliché speaks volumes about modernity, its
   attendant ideologies, and its relationship to history, or at least our
   common perception of that relationship. History is something modernity
   moves away from. Modernism, we know, is the disavowal of the past, or,
   in music, the dissolution of harmony: architectural brutalism, nomadic
   literary stream-of-consciousness, Fordist production lines. In other
   words, the artistic response to industrial alienation—and in some
   iterations, a kind of perverse celebration of it.

   And yet, ghosts of a distant, oftentimes medieval, past haunt modernity
   interminably. A liminal period of imaginative possibility wedged
   between classical antiquity and the Enlightenment, the ‘medieval’ it
   seems to me, has, in its afterlives, been modernity’s Other. From the
   protomodernisms of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the utopian and
   fantasy socialism of William Morris, to Wagnerian Romanticism and the
   neo-gothic literary and architectural revivals, medievalism informs
   modernity profoundly. In the twentieth century this only intensified
   and diversified, and it is this paradox—that is, for the past to inform
   the overtly forward-thinking agendas associated with modernism—that
   inspired the conference.

   The conference began, then, with a ‘Prehistories’ session, providing
   crucial context from musical modernity’s long dawn in the nineteenth
   century. Belinda Robinson (University of Oxford) spoke first about
   Hungarian nationalist composer Ferenc Erkel and the historically-themed
   opera Bátori Mária from 1840. Her paper articulated highly salient
   themes to which we would return many times: chiefly, the way that
   contemporary social and political issues might be played out on the
   medieval canvas. But Robinson’s insights, more significantly, sought to
   problematise a prevailing understanding of the contemporary
   relationship between past and present in art (and, here, in opera).
   Erkel gave no allegorical consolation (and, thus, atonement) for
   Hungarian nation building in his historical rendering of the story of
   Bátori Mária. Rather, the opera’s vision of history is tragic and
   cyclical: the past is not some distant repository that we merely
   ‘learn’ from, but it is, instead, simultaneous with both present and
   future, unresolved. Tadhg Sauvey (University of Cambridge) followed
   this up with a revealing discussion of the legend of César Franck and
   the cult of Franckisme. A sort of fin-de-siècle medievalism, followers
   of Franckisme promoted a primitivistic critique of the present and a
   retreat into spiritual simplicity and musical purity in the era of
   French Symbolist ascendency. Highly prescient, Franckisme prefigures a
   number of musical medievalisms that would come.

   The second session concerned musical modernity specifically,
   demonstrating medievalism’s diverse, and contradictory, legacy in the
   twentieth century. John Gabriel (University of Hong Kong), for
   instance, took us to interwar Germany, and the medievalist origins of
   Gebrauchsmusik, which saw in the medieval period a truly ‘functional’
   musical praxis. In particular, his paper contrasted the left-wing Hanns
   Eisler with the conservative Ernst Krenek: the former repurposing
   medieval religious didacticism and communal singing, and the latter
   melding twelve-tone technique with a neo-medievalist lionisation of the
   Holy Roman Empire as a model for then Fascist Austria. Nana Katsia
   (Tbilisi State Conservatoire) revealed an ongoing tradition of the
   medieval ‘mystery play’ in operas by Wagner, Schoenberg, and Messiaen.
   Arguably the beginning of European theatre, the mystery play (or,
   rather, the hybrid opera-mystery play as it becomes here) may have
   transformed beyond recognition, but it is nevertheless governed by its
   logics of religious ritual. In twentieth-century opera, the mystery
   play is not so much as preserved, but transformed.

   The session then moved onwards in time to the latter half of the
   twentieth century: Violetta Kostka (Academy of Music in Gdansk)
   presented on Polish-born composer Paweł Szymańsky. A leading figure in
   the Polish contemporary music scene, Szymańsky, despite having a highly
   idiosyncratic style and sound, derives the majority of his music from
   transformations of earlier musical styles. Two pieces highlighted by
   Kostka demonstrate contrasting approaches to medievalism taken by a
   living composer: Miserere, a choral piece, and Three Pieces, an
   algorithmically generated work for three recorders and a metronome
   (both 1993). Finally, Joseph Wong (Open University of Hong Kong),
   himself a composer, provided a broad overview of musical medievalist
   borrowing in modern music: in Lutosławski, Ligeti, and in Takemitsu.
   His emphasis on stylistic diversity among composers in the latter half
   of the twentieth century came to highlight how reinvention and
   revitalisation are central to his composers’ creative processes.

   A final session for the day tackled medievalism in opera: Giuseppe
   Montemagno (Academic of Fine Arts, Catania) delivered a fascinating
   paper (cowritten with tenor Giuseppe Filianoti) on Francesco Cilèa’s
   Gloria (1907) set in fourteenth-century Siena, and detailed its vast
   web of influences, drawing it, too, into a context of fin-de-siècle
   Symbolism and Franciscan simplicity already touched upon that morning.
   George Haggett (Royal Holloway, University of London) then delivered
   his ‘lurid’ account of George Benjamin’s landmark 2012 opera Written on
   Skin: a body-centred reading of ‘operatic ekphrasis’ which sees that
   opera’s medievalism (its source material a thirteenth-century Occitan
   razo) as something profoundly physical—viscerally so.

   The first day culminated with a keynote from David Matthews (University
   of Manchester), a professor of medieval literature and a leader in the
   burgeoning interdisciplinary field of Medievalism Studies. That field
   was, in some respects, an inspiration for this conference, and it has
   been my intention here to bring its ideas—above all, its celebration of
   anachronism and co-temporality—to musicology (and, indeed, vice versa).
   Professor Matthews, then, provided a hugely important introduction for
   the mainly musicological conference: he covered the ‘long decade’
   (1839-51) that he sees as constituting medievalism’s ‘high watermark’,
   restorative and reflective types of nostalgia, and he set down the
   gauntlet for what a musical contribution to the field might look like.
   That keynote was followed by a very rewarding set of roundtable
   responses: from Lisa Colton (University of Huddersfield), Edward Venn
   (University of Leeds), myself, and another ‘outsider’, Andrew Elliott
   (University of Lincoln), who works on medievalism in modern media and
   politics.

   The second day pushed the first day’s discussion into yet new
   directions, and a session on ‘Medievalism in Practice’ brought together
   performers, composers, and practitioners to engage the realities of
   creating and innovating with the medieval in the present. Stef Conner
   (University of Huddersfield), framed that session with a critical
   account of historical performance practice and a defence of
   subjectivity. Her paper dealt with the vexed, but highly important,
   notion of authenticity and the considerable distance between rigid
   types of scholarly thought and those taken by performers who propose to
   embody the traditions exemplified by their medieval sources. Litha
   Efthymiou (University of Lincoln) delivered a first-hand account of a
   composer working, collaboratively, to develop a stage piece that was
   inspired by ancient Old Hispanic chant notation: the piece, Myisi was
   premiered in 2015 at the Tête à Tête opera festival.

   Carmen Troncoso and Lynette Quek (both University of York)—a recorder
   player and a sound artist, respectively—explored their own
   collaborations on a set of pieces which engaged the origins of the
   recorder. Moreover, they offered a notion of ‘simultaneous inhabitancy’
   and described the juxtaposition of elements both old and new in their
   music, and in the evolution of the recorder itself. Carlos Zamora
   (University of York), a composer from Chile ended the session with an
   analysis of a piece of his own—Stampide of Birds for recorder
   quartet—inspired by medieval estampie dance forms (and conceived in a
   Pythagorean tuning).

   The final session of the conference (‘Medievalism on screen’) ended on
   a thoroughly modern (if not strictly modernist) note, with papers about
   recent ‘historical’ television shows. William Everett (University of
   Missouri) even brought popular music theatre to the mix speaking about
   Galavant (2014-15), a comic television musical combining Broadway
   tropes with medieval contexts. Strikingly, this charmingly silly series
   embodies (and, in the process, comments on) medievalism instructively,
   and refracts through its thirteenth-century lens major
   twenty-first-century issues, including, but not limited to, race,
   gender, class, and politics. This was followed by James Cook
   (University of Edinburgh), who, to end the conference, extended the
   medievalist purview to Sky’s 2018 Brittania series, a dramatisation of
   the Roman invasion of the British Isles. Indeed, Cook also challenged
   the notion of linear time here: pre-Roman Britain’s pagan population
   proposes an analogously barbarous challenge to Roman enlightenment,
   and—pitched as the show is as a sort of commentary on contemporary
   debates of national identity—draws much upon established medievalist
   musical tropes to melt a straightforward, reducible, kind of
   chronology.

   The past is not mere history, then (or should I say, history is not
   merely in the past?). More than a bygone space to learn from, it
   continues to have a life of its own: refracting and transforming our
   present, and influencing the future. This conference successfully
   provided a forum for this reflection, refining the Call for Papers’
   initial themes. At our present historical juncture, where modernity’s
   progress might feel in doubt, there is an added urgency in this
   discussion: if modernism (and modernity) seems to assume a certain
   unidirectional temporal flow, medievalism reminds us that,
   imaginatively speaking, progress is not always guaranteed—or that we
   may not find it where we expect to.

   Alexander Kolassa is a Lecturer in Music at the Open University; he is
   a musicologist who writes on contemporary music and medievalism as well
   as sound and music in film, and a composer whose music has been
   performed nationally.
