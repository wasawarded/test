Abstract

   As more information becomes available on the World Wide Web (there are
   currently over 4 billion pages covering most areas of human endeavor),
   it becomes more difficult to provide effective search tools for
   information access. Today, people access web information through two
   main kinds of search interfaces: Browsers (clicking and following
   hyperlinks) and Query Engines (queries in the form of a set of keywords
   showing the topic of
   interest). The first process is tentative and time consuming and the
   second may not satisfy the user because of many inaccurate and
   irrelevant results. Better support is needed for expressing one's
   information need and returning high quality search results by web
   search tools. There appears to be a need for systems that do reasoning
   under uncertainty and are flexible enough to recover from the
   contradictions, inconsistencies, and irregularities that such reasoning
   involves.

   Active Logic is a formalism that has been developed with real-world
   applications and their challenges in mind. Motivating its design is the
   thought that one of the factors that supports the flexibility of human
   reasoning is that it takes place step-wise, in time. Active Logic is
   one of a family of inference engines (step-logics) that explicitly
   reason in time, and incorporate a history of their reasoning as they
   run. This characteristic makes Active Logic systems more flexible than
   traditional AI systems and therefore more suitable for commonsense,
   real-world reasoning. In this report we mainly will survey recent
   advances in machine learning and crawling problems related to the web.
   We will review the continuum of supervised to semi-supervised to
   unsupervised learning problems, highlight the specific challenges which
   distinguish information retrieval in the hypertext domain and will
   summarize the key areas of recent and ongoing research. We will
   concentrate on topic-specific search engines, focused crawling, and
   finally will propose an Information Integration Environment, based on
   the Active Logic framework.

   Keywords: Web Information Retrieval, Web Crawling, Focused Crawling,
