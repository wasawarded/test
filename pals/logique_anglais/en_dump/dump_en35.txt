What is Oracle WebLogic Server?

   Oracle WebLogic Server is a leading e-commerce online transaction
   processing (OLTP) platform, developed to connect users in distributed
   computing production environments and to facilitate the integration of
   mainframe applications with distributed corporate data and
   applications.

   WebLogic is an Application Server that runs on a middle tier, between
   back-end databases and related applications and browser-based thin
   clients. WebLogic Server mediates the exchange of requests from the
   client tier with responses from the back-end tier.
   Oracle WebLogic Server architecture Oracle WebLogic Server operates as
   middleware for distributed enterprise applications.

   WebLogic Server is based on Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
   (formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition or J2EE), the
   standard platform used to create Java-based multi-tier enterprise
   applications. Java EE platform technologies were developed through the
   efforts of BEA Systems and other vendors in collaboration with the main
   developer, Sun Microsystems.

   Because Java EE applications are standardized modules, WebLogic can
   automate many system-level tasks that would otherwise have demanded
   programming time.

What is WebLogic used for?

   Enterprises use WebLogic Server to develop distributed applications,
   enabling users to access applications from a client -- web browser,
   mobile device or any other type of client program or device using a
   program written in Java or any other language -- and systems on the
   back end -- databases, enterprise information systems or mainframe
   applications.

WebLogic features and capabilities

   As one component of Oracle's Fusion middleware platform, WebLogic
   capabilities include the following:
     * support for databases including Oracle Database, Oracle MySQL
       Enterprise, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2;
     * .NET interoperability;
     * native integration with other middleware and APIs; and
     * support for a security model that separates security code from
       business logic.

   typical middleware architecture Oracle WebLogic Server is a component
   of Oracle's Fusion middleware platform.

   The main features of WebLogic server include the following:
     * connectors that make it possible for any legacy application on any
       client to interoperate with server applications;
     * Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) components;
     * resource pooling;
     * connection sharing enables improved application scalability; and
     * an administration console with a user interface makes management
       tasks more efficient and includes features such as:
          + Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support for the encryption of data
            transmissions; and
          + authentication and Authorization mechanisms to make
            applications and transactions secure.

WebLogic server architecture

   A WebLogic server installation includes at least one WebLogic server
   instance but may include multiple server instances on one or more
   separate computer servers.

   Multiple WebLogic servers are administered together as a unit called a
   domain. Each WebLogic domain includes a single administration server
   and may contain additional server instances managed by the
   administration server. When these managed servers are configured to be
   part of a WebLogic Server cluster, they enable scaling for
   high-availability applications.

   WebLogic Server domains can also be deployed on a public cloud, using
   the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes.

How popular is WebLogic?

   WebLogic Server is intended for high-traffic applications, so it is not
   surprising that it is not used by many sites. According to W3Techs --
   Word Wide Web Technology Surveys, usage statistics for WebLogic Server
   indicate it is used by less than 0.1% of all websites running a known
   web server.

   However, WebLogic Server market share increases for the top-ranking
   busiest sites. As an integral part of Oracle's application server
   stack, WebLogic Server does not need to be popular outside of its
   target market: large enterprises that require highly scalable server
   environments for OLTP applications.

Oracle WebLogic Server vs. Apache Tomcat

   The Apache Tomcat web server is often compared with WebLogic Server.
   The Tomcat web server serves static content and dynamic content in web
   applications delivered in Java servlets and JavaServer Pages.

   The fundamental difference between WebLogic Server and Apache Tomcat is
   that WebLogic is an application server. That means WebLogic includes
   components that provide web services as well as a server environment
   for accessing enterprise data resources like databases and transaction
   processing.
   Apache Tomcat vs Oracle WebLogic Server The difference between WebLogic
   Server and Apache Tomcat is the difference between an application
   server and a web server.

History of WebLogic

   WebLogic server was the first J2EE application server.
     * 1995: WebLogic, Inc. founded.
     * 1997: First release of WebLogic Tengah.
     * 1998: WebLogic, Inc., acquired by BEA Systems.
     * 2008: BEA Systems acquired by Oracle.
     * 2020: WebLogic Server version 14 released.

   WebLogic Server can solve some thorny problems for enterprises that
   need to tightly integrate their information systems with a scalable
   OLTP platform. It may be too much for simpler applications; find out if
   Apache Tomcat server works better for your applications.
