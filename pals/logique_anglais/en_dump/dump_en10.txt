   Our Computing Science program prepares you to be a technological leader
   with a global perspective.

   Our graduates are creative problem solvers, lifelong learners, and
   highly adaptable leaders in our rapidly changing world. In addition to
   studying fundamental computing science topics, our students choose from
   a variety of elective courses, including artificial intelligence,
   software engineering, computer graphics, databases, programming
   languages, computer networking, and virtual reality. We encourage our
   students to engage in undergraduate research with their computing
   science professors. These research projects often result in students
   presenting their work at international conferences. Past students have
   coauthored papers with their professors and published their findings in
   peer-reviewed journals, providing them with valuable experience and
   identifiable skills. Through our program, our students gain expertise
   in their area, as well as character development, as they learn to
   navigate between technology and society from a distinctly Christian
   worldview. Graduates from our computing science program stand out as
   confident professionals and choose from a variety of career paths, such
   as software developer, systems manager, support specialist, trainer,
   software engineer, technical writer, software tester or supporter, and
   entrepreneur.

   We also have a Data Science stream as a valuable option in the major,
   which identifies a group of courses intended to provide excellent
   access to graduate programs and employment opportunities.

Alumni Perspective

   “The courses I took at TWU helped me gain the skills needed for the job
   as a web developer. Through my liberal arts education, I experienced a
   sampling of many different fields, which helped me decide my career
   path. TWU’s strong sense of community—through friends and also
   teachers—was fundamental to my becoming who I am today. I was exposed
   to opportunities that wouldn’t have been possible at a different
   university.”

   - Andrew Chell ('11)
