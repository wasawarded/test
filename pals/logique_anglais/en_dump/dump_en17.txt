   Professor Payne joined The American University of Paris in 2008 after
   teaching for several years at universities in his home
   country, Australia. In his research, he is primarily interested in
   gender and sexuality in media and popular culture, and how queer theory
   can generate new approaches for media studies scholarship. He has
   published widely in these fields, focusing on such topics as the
   construction of masculinity on gay dating websites and Australian TV,
   the circulation of panic in the mediation of gender and sexuality, the
   inherent queerness of social media discourses, and the queer potential
   of deteriorated media experiences.
   Payne has published two monographs. The first, The Promiscuity of
   Network Culture: Queer Theory and Digital Media (Routledge 2015) takes
   as a point of departure the resignification of "viral" circulation for
   a digital media context. The book examines the multiple intimacies that
   characterize network culture, including the everyday practices of
   "sharing" on social media. Interrogating a wide range of examples, from
   Facebook to viral celebrity to the Abu Ghraib photos, the book uncovers
   the queer and entrepreneurial logic governing what circulates in
   digital networks and how we talk about them.

   His second monograph, L'Homme blessé, published in the Queer Film
   Classics series by McGill-Queen's University Press (2022), is a
   book-length study of the pioneering 1983 French film by director
   Patrice Chéreau, paying particular attention to the film's visual
   grammar of queer desire, the social and political circumstances of the
   film's production, and its reception in various international
   contexts.

   Payne's current research explores the materialities of everyday media,
   in particular the spaces, infrastructures, objects, and affects that
   characterise and make possible our encounters with media.
