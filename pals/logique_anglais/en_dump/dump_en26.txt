Real Clear Daf: Q & A Review

   A review of some of this week’s daf yomi key concepts (Shabbos Chol
   Ha’moed Sukkos – Sanhedrin)

   By Rabbi Shmuel Wise

   Q: What is the halachah if a “dead man” kills?

   A: We discussed this fascinating issue on 78a. By “dead man” we mean a
   person who has suffered a specific mortal injury (e.g. his esophagus
   has been severed) that defines him as a halachic “treifah.” Rava there
   states that if someone kills a treifah person he is not liable as a
   murderer, for the Torah regards this man as already dead! Rava then
   rules that if the treifah person kills, he is not subject to the death
   penalty (unless he literally committed the murder in front of the
   court). Why not? Because of the requirement that testimony always be
   subject to refutation through the system of hazamah.

   Namely, we require the possibility that future witnesses will come in
   and refute the first testimony by reporting that the earlier witnesses
   were with them at the time they claim to have witnessed the crime. The
   Torah decrees that the new testimony completely discredits the first
   testimony, and we administer to the original witnesses the punishment
   that they had conspired to bring about on their victim.

   Based on the above, we could never bring admissible testimony against
   this treifah person who allegedly committed murder. For in the event
   that new witnesses were to come and discredit the first testimony
   against the treifah, the Torah would not say to punish the false
   witnesses with the death penalty that they tried to bring against the
   treifah. That is because of the idea mentioned earlier that the Torah
   considers the treifah to be already dead. That being so, hazamah, which
   is defined as a reciprocal punishment for the false testimony, is
   inapplicable here where the false testimony merely sought to kill a
   person who was already considered dead (killing these healthy witnesses
   would not be reciprocal).

   Being that hazamah could never apply to this situation, the original
   testimony against the treifah can never be accepted to begin with. So
   this treifah murderer walks, scot-free (at least until he drops dead of
   his treifah injury!).

   Later in the Gemara, Rav Ashi takes this concept one step further and
   considers a case in which treifah witnesses testify that someone
   committed a capital offense, and subsequently other witnesses testify
   that the treifah witnesses’ testimony was false (“they were with us at
   the time”). Rav Ashi asserts that we would never reciprocate and impose
   the death penalty on the treifah witnesses because their testimony
   would never be accepted to begin with.

   Why not? Because if we take the case one more step, it is evident that
   their testimony could never subject them to a hazamah punishment. The
   treifah witnesses aren’t subject to hazamah, because the second set of
   witnesses aren’t subject to hazamah. This might sound puzzling: I
   thought it’s the first group of witnesses that is always refuted
   through hazamah; the second group is always the party responsible for
   falsifying the earlier group. But the truth is that in theory the
   tables could turn again if a third group of witnesses testifies that it
   cannot be true that group #2 was with group #1 because they (group #2)
   were with them (group #3) at that time.

   If this happened, the halachah would be that the original testimony of
   group #1 is restored and group #2 would be subject to the reciprocal
   hazamah punishment! In our case, however, we wouldn’t be able to punish
   group #2 since their false testimony (that the treifah witnesses are
   false witnesses and therefore deserve the hazamah punishment) would
   have killed people that are already considered dead!

   The bottom line of all of this, argues Rav Ashi, is that we could never
   kill treifah witnesses who attempt to falsely testify that someone
   committed a capital offense, because their testimony would never be
   accepted to begin with.

   Rava, however, does not agree with this. In Rava’s view, we would
   accept the testimony of treifah witnesses regarding a capital offense,
   and we would therefore kill them if they were exposed as false
   witnesses through hazamah. What of Rav Ashi’s point that group #2’s
   testimony isn’t subject to hazamah (and consequently should be rejected
   altogether, with the result that the treifah witnesses’ testimony
   should be rejected to begin with, as explained above)? Rashi explains
   that Rava is of the opinion that the requirement that testimony be
   subject to hazamah doesn’t apply to the testimony of the witnesses who
   are exposing the previous testimony as false (e.g. group #2).

   The logic for this is as follows. On the face of it, there is no
   rational way to explain the halachah of hazamah. For why should we
   believe the second group of witnesses any more than the first group,
   which obviously claims that it did witness this crime? Yet the Torah
   decreed that when subsequent witnesses refute the earlier testimony
   through hazamah, we regard the earlier witnesses as entirely
   discredited. So since the Torah evidently gave “superpowers” to the
   second testimony, it should come as no surprise that the Torah accepts
   this testimony even if it possesses the defect of not being subject to
   hazamah. In other words, if the Torah upholds this testimony in spite
   of the fact that two other credible witnesses have contradicted it,
   then it logically follows that this testimony can weather the
   relatively minor issue that it lacks the built-in deterrent that it be
   subject to refutation by hazamah.

   How would Rav Ashi respond to this argument? Perhaps Rav Ashi would say
   that you have no right to make any logical extensions from a law that
   is clearly not governed by logic. This viewpoint can be compared to the
   view that, ironically, is expressed by Rava back on 27a. The Gemara
   there explores the question of whether we apply the status of a witness
   whose testimony was refuted through hazamah retroactively. That is, do
   we consider any testimony he had given between the false testimony and
   the date on which he was falsified to be testimony given by a “liar”
   and consequently invalid testimony?

   Rava there states that we do not apply this false witness’s
   disqualified status retroactively. Why not? Because since (as explained
   above) the whole concept of hazamah defies logic, we cannot treat it as
   a regular case where we would certainly establish the person’s status
   from the moment of the crime itself. So Rav Ashi could apply this kind
   of argument: we have no right to extrapolate from hazamah and say that
   the Torah also exempted the requirement that testimony be subject to
   hazamah. We must stick with strictly what the actual verse states and
   not assume anything else.

   Which begs the question: how would Rava distinguish between the issue
   of 27a and our Gemara? Seemingly, Rava is playing both sides of the
   fence here. Perhaps Rava would say this: Indeed, as is clear from his
   view on 27a, we cannot take the teaching of hazamah beyond its
   bare-bones teaching, which is that when later witnesses refute these
   witnesses, we consider them false witnesses. Because this is a novel
   ruling, we can only apply it today and going forward. But on our page,
   Rava is asserting that logic compels us to say that an exemption from
   the normal requirement that testimony be subject to hazamah must have
   been included in the teaching itself. Much like the classic example of
   “if a guy can lift 100 pounds he must be able to lift 50,” the same,
   Rava argues, applies to the second set of witnesses; if the Torah gave
   them the power to override even actual witnesses then, perforce, they
   have the power to be accepted even without being subject to hazamah.

   With that, I wish you a joyful and meaningful chag.
