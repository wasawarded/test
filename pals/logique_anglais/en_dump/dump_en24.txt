Academics

   Shape your own path in the liberal arts and sciences with K’s
   innovative and integrated approach to academics.

   With 32 majors, 22 minors and 13 concentrations, students can customize
   their experiences for a personalized approach to their college
   education. There’s no need to follow a prescribed list of general
   education requirements with our open curriculum.

   Unsure of your major? Don’t worry.

   Kalamazoo College is one of the best colleges for undecided majors
   because our students wait until the second term of sophomore year to
   officially declare their majors⁠—while still typically graduating in
   four years.

   Find out how these academic programs and the K-Plan do more in four
   years so our students can do more in a lifetime.
