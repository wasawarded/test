Working Group resolutions

   All the resolutions passed by the WG are collected in this page, in
   reverse chronological order. However, the resolutions to accept minutes
   as true records of meetings are not repeated here.

   Resolutions from 17 February Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: RIF-RDF combinations are not defined in case rif:iri or
       rdf:text are used in the imported RDF graphs.
     * RESOLVED: Change the test cases to "import rejection tests" and
       close issue-90.

   Resolutions from 10 February Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-63 with the understanding that the Group
       construct is sufficient.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-65 with the understanding that PRD does not
       add specific syntax to specify halting tests.

   Resolutions from 27 Jan 2009 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Core, BLD, PRD will not have semantic metadata; removing
       metadata from a ruleset will not change the entailments - closing
       ISSUE-50.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-83 - the existing presentation syntax
       ambiguities are resolvable.
     * RESOLVED: Accept
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/Argument_names_in_uniterms_1.
     * RESOLVED: Accept
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/Argument_names_in_uniterms_2.

   Resolutions from F2F12, 14-15 January 2009, hosted by Oracle in
   Portland, OR. Minutes day one, day two
     * RESOLVED: approve test case RDF_Combination_Blank_Node for BLD,
       Core, PRD, and Safe-Core.
     * RESOLVED: Approve test case RDF_Combination_Constant_Equivalence_2
       (for all dialects, and it's Safe).
     * RESOLVED: Approve test case RDF_Combination_Constant_Equivalence_3
       (for all dialects, and it's Safe).
     * RESOLVED: Approve test case
       RDF_Combination_Constant_Equivalence_Graph_Entailment_2 but be sure
       to make it clear that this is a different kind of test case, about
       RDF entailment. (Current wiki template does not properly show
       that.).
     * RESOLVED: Approve test case RDF_Combination_Member_1 for all
       dialects (BLD, Core, CoreSafe, PRD).
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-39, saying ruleset-imports is in Core, and
       we're not going to define an "includes" at this time (in part
       because we don't know what it might mean). 'Imports' ends up in
       PRD, where it's not ideal, but not really harmful. Some version of
       PRD may do a more sophisticated import at some point.
     * RESOLVED: PRD will not address interop with RDF and OWL directly --
       there is no work to do there. SWC will instead be updated to be
       phrased in terms of [safe] Core, so it can be (in most ways)
       inherited for PRD.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-82, given understandings in discussion so far
       today. Core as specialization of PRD is just work to do. Yes,
       safeness restriction will resolve backward chaining problem (action
       on Jos). Does Core compatibility with RDF+OWL extend to PRD? only
       to the extend that's automatic through Core.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-48. membership (#) in Core facts and
       conditions. subclass (##) not in Core.
     * RESOLVED: close issue-68 with no Named-Argument Uniterms (NAU) in
       Core or PRD.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-72 saying "No" (Option D). (Nothing like
       skolem functions in Core.) We regret we were unable to find a good
       design to address this need.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-33 with the understand that our mechanisms
       for accessing RDF and XML data sources, and using externals, will
       be sufficient.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-78. The only Externals in BLD (and Core, and
       PRD) will be Predicates and Functions. No external frames, no
       external equality, etc.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-69; there will be a Core schema, included in
       BLD and PRD schemas. see ACTION-692.
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-46; no decision to make at this time. If
       someone produces a proposal for modules, we may consider it.
     * RESOLVED: Add xsd:nonNegativeInteger, xsd:anyURI, xsd:hexBinary,
       xsd:base64Binary to RIF Core. In RIF, the xsd numeric types will
       have disjoint value spaces (as in XSD1.1, unlike current OWL 2
       drafts)-- we'll push for OWL to change and assume they will. [The
       owl:* types will be decided separately. Value spaces of Binaries
       will be decided separately. When those are decided, it will close
       issue-81].
     * RESOLVED: Add owl:real and owl:realPlus to RIF Core, BLD, PRD.

   Resolutions from 6 January 2009 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: add isLiteralOfType and isLiteralNotOfType (Changing
       guards to return true only for literals that are/are not of the
       type, false for non-literals) and remove specific type-named guards
       (e.g. isInteger, isNotInteger). Closing ISSUE-79 and the
       membership/non-membership part of ISSUE-80.

   Resolutions from 9 December 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Replace in UCR the requirement on Rule language coverage
       by the following statement: Because of the great diversity of rule
       languages, no one interchange language is likely to be able to
       bridge between all. Instead, RIF provides dialects which are each
       targeted at a cluster of similar rule languages. RIF must allow
       intra-dialect interoperation, i.e. interoperability between
       semantically similar rule languages (via interchange of RIF rules)
       within one dialect, and it should support inter-dialect
       interoperation, i.e. interoperation between dialects with maximum
       overlap.
     * RESOLVED: Publish UCR as WD4
     * RESOLVED: Publish Core as WD2
     * RESOLVED: Publish PRD as WD2
     * RESOLVED: Publish DTB as WD2

   Resolutions from 2 December 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: to publish the test case document as FPWD (conditional on
       Sandro's approval of modifications)

   Resolutions from 25 Nov 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Include in UCR a new requirement on Internationalized
       text: RIF must support internationalized text - that is, text that
       additionally conveys information in terms of a language tag.
     * RESOLVED: Add equal and not-equal builtins for string in DTB.

   Resolutions from 11 Nov 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Publish rdf:text as a FPWD, jointly with OWL-WG, adding
       an editor's note about infinity (actions Jos, Axel)
     * RESOLVED: In RIF-PRD, the conflict resolution strategy for a set of
       rules will be indicated in some way, associated with the top-level
       group. RIF-PRD 1.0 will specify only one normative conflict
       resolution strategy, as specified in csma's email [9] (essentially:
       refraction+priority+recency).
     * RESOLVED: RIF-PRD 1.0 MAY specify other conflict resolution
       strategies for suggested use, but these will not be mandatory.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-64.

   Resolutions from 4 November 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Parameterize the conformance clauses of Core with
       safeness requirements "strict" and "none" (default: "none").
       Closing ISSUE-70.

   Resolutions from 21 Oct 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Core should keep safe disjunction in rule bodies.
       Implementations can be direct or use a well-known preprocessing
       step.
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue-75.
     * RESOLVED: accept Test Case Annotation Entailment

   Resolutions from 7 Oct 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Add "New" construct with Gary's proposed semantics to
       represent the creation of new frame objects in then-part of PRD
       rules; not excluding extending it later with the use of
       constructors once we resolve how to call "methods".
     * RESOLVED: Add a construct with Gary's proposed semantics to
       represent the declaration of local variables for binding to New
       frames in the then-part of PRD rules ; not excluding that later
       resolutions might extend the use of local variables in the action
       part.
     * RESOLVED: Extend "Retract" construct with Gary's semantics to
       represent the removal of a frame object in then-part of PRD rules,
       that is, to represent the removal of an object from the instances
       of its class as well as all the frames with that object in the
       object position.
     * RESOLVED: accept

     * RESOLVED: RIF will not specify a mechanism for profiles
       (sub-languages of dialects, which are not themselves a dialect),
       (addressing part of issue-29) link
     * RESOLVED: Future RIF dialects SHOULD extend Core. (Closing

       function and predicate calls in rule conditions and keep external

       conditions in core link
     * RESOLVED: Close issue-74, saying Core will have both Predicates

       membership) link

   Resolutions from 23 Sep 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Each RIF test case MUST, eventually, be provided in RIF
       XML, and MAY be provided in some syntax for which a
       translator-to-XML has been promised. The translator SHOULD be
       available for use by the WG to check the translation.

   Resolutions from 16 Sep 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Core will not have equality in the conclusion

   Resolutions from 9 Sep 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Core will not have named-argument uniterms

   Resolutions from 5 Aug 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Remove section 4.3.5 (casting function for rif:iri) from
       DTB.

   Resolutions from 29 July 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Publish the July 28 snapshot as BLD LC, after correction
       of the HTML problems.
     * RESOLVED: Publish the July 28 snapshot as SWC LC.
     * RESOLVED: Publish the July 28 snapshot as UCR 3rd public WD.

       the links are fixed.
     * RESOLVED: Publish the July 28 snapshot as PRD 1st public WD.

   Resolutions from telecon 1 July 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Mark "External Frames" AT RISK in BLD.
     * RESOLVED: Change the tag name of the sub elements of Equal in BLD
       XML from side to left and right

   Resolutions from telecon 24 June 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: BLD refers to DTB by version number. If/when dialects
       need other things, they refer to new versions. BLD still refers to
       old one.

   Resolutions from telecon 10 June 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: reword req. 5.2.8 to "RIF semantics"
     * RESOLVED: replace req. 5.2.9 with re-wording: "The semantics of a
       RIF document must be uniquely determined by the content of the
       document, without out-of-band data."
     * RESOLVED: change req. 5.2.12 to "must" support ability to merge
       rule sets
     * RESOLVED: change req. 5.2.13 "will" to "must" & remove
       parenthetical comment: RIF must support the identification of rule
       sets.
     * RESOLVED: Move 5.3.1 to 5.2.14 and make it a SHOULD instead of
       MUST. (support XML as data)

   Resolutions from telecon 3 June 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: change text of 5.1.3 to: It must be possible to create
       new RIF dialects which extend existing dialects (thus providing
       backward compatibility) and are handled gracefully by systems which
       support existing dialects (thus providing forward compatibility).
     * RESOLVED: For this next draft of UCR, add an editor's note to 5.1.6
       to note that we're still working on how to define a coverage
       requirement. (unless we come up with some consensus text before
       publication)
     * RESOLVED: rephrase 5.2.1 to: The RIF specifications must provide
       clear conformance criteria, defining what is or is not a conformant
       RIF implementation.

   Resolutions from F2F10 (F2F10_Minutes)
     * RESOLVED: BLD will include Conjunction in the rule head (the "then"
       part)
     * RESOLVED: remove language about all the subtypes of xsd:string
       being required (from DTB)
     * RESOLVED: DTB will provide the menu of datatypes and builtins which
       dialects can use, by reference, when they state which datatypes and
       builtins must be supported by implementations.
     * RESOLVED: add xs:dayTimeDuration and xs:yearMonthDuration, but NOT
       duration, to those required in BLD (and of course DTB), as in
       http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#dt-yearMonthDuration
     * RESOLVED: add builtin predicates to BLD and DTB:
       pred:numeric-less-or-equal, pred:numberic-greater-or-equal,
       pred:numberic-not-equal (they amount to shortcuts, to avoid
       disjunction).
     * RESOLVED: Publish DTB as a FPWD once changes decided so far today
       are made (and reviewed by Chris)
     * RESOLVED: remove aliases for symbol space identifiers in RIF
     * RESOLVED: modify Presentation Syntax to include "Const ::= STRING"
       (allowing "chat" as short for "chat"^^xs:string).
     * RESOLVED: add xsd:double as a required symbol space
     * RESOLVED: reuse NumericLiteral from SPARQL
       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rNumericLiteral giving us
       INTEGER, DECIMAL, and DOUBLE to the Presentation Syntax
     * RESOLVED: modify presentation syntax so that alphanumeric
       identifiers starting with "_" are shortcut for rif:local (so _foo
       is short for "foo"^^rif:local)
     * RESOLVED: Adopt SPARQL convention for using backslash to allow
       quotes (and cr, lf, tab, etc) within quoted strings (in
       Presentation Syntax).
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 56 as addressed by the resolutions this
       morning.
     * RESOLVED: Publish SWC as LAST CALL Working Draft, after changes
       agreed upon this session and yesterday are made (and checked by
       CSMA)
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 49 with decisions made so far today
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 54 with at-risk label as decided this
       morning.
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 60 as decided this morning -- if they are
       incomparable it's an error
     * RESOLVED: Answer to Dan is that in BLD, pred and funcs have one
       arity, and it is correct that the restriction holds even across
       multiple documents. So the requirement is met -- rulesets can be
       merged -- but if one ruleset is in error, then the merged version
       will be able to detect the error.
     * RESOLVED: in the RIF XML syntax (as long as we stick with this
       non-RDF style), attributes will have no namespace (be unqualified)
       (so that we can avoid "rif:" in documents)
     * RESOLVED: Change External(ATOMIC) to External(Atom) or
       External(Frame) and add text explaining how External frames are
       supported by the semantics.
     * RESOLVED: accept the conformance statement on
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/Conformance for BLD, up to the
       separator line.
     * RESOLVED: we'll have an XML such that RIF can operate on RIF
       documents at a RIF-syntactic-level instead of a DOM level. Requires
       something like numbering arguments or rdf:parsetype="collection" or
       ordered="yes".
     * RESOLVED: use an XML attribute rif:ordered="yes" (as exemplified
       above) or using an equivalent unique method to specify order, which
       works like rdf:parseType="Collection" (and rif:type attribute gets
       qualified again.)
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 34 as addressed by text currently in BLD at
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/BLD#Conformance_Clauses
     * RESOLVED: RIF will use rif:ordered="yes". This item will be marked
       "at risk", saying the name and XML details on this bit may change.
     * RESOLVED: Adopt the XML syntax for metadata in
       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rif-wg/2008May/0036.html
       and given as the first example on
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/Metadata_examples, using
       conjunction-of-frames instead of all formulas.
     * RESOLVED: the <id> and <meta> elements can occur under any Class
       element (this matter is underspecified in 0036, and previous
       resolution).
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 51 (metadata syntax and rule identification)
       give the decisions made so far this meeting.
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 58 (Comments) by suggesting people use Dublin
       Core, RDFS, and OWL properties for metadata, along the lines of
       http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Annotations -- specifically
       owl:versionInfo, rdfs:label, rdfs:comment, rdfs:seeAlso,
       rdfs:isDefinedBy, dc:creator, dc:description, dc:date, foaf:maker.
       This goes in BLD (near where the metadata syntax goes).
     * RESOLVED: close Issue 55 (striping and xml syntax and rdf/xml
       syntax compatibility) addressed by decisions made so far this
       meeting
     * RESOLVED: move Issue 57 (xml syntax extensibility) out of critical
       path
     * RESOLVED: We say metadata SHOULD survive the translation
       from-and-back-to RIF
     * RESOLVED: close Issue 59 as discussed in this meeting
     * RESOLVED: In Presentation Syntax, the IRIs in rif:iri Consts can be
       relative.
     * RESOLVED: We'll use XML 1.0 as amended http://www.w3.org/TR/xml
       (not XML 1.1) for the XML syntax for BLD.
     * RESOLVED: make equality-in-the-head a feature-at-risk.
     * RESOLVED: Mark "at risk" the strictness part of the conformance
       clause
     * RESOLVED: Advance BLD to Last Call, pending satisfactory completion
       of the edits decided at this meeting.
     * RESOLVED: Publish PRD as a FPWD, given the editorial changes
       decided so far this meeting (after confirmation of edits by Gary
       and Adrian).
     * RESOLVED: The WG requests a 1-year extension, with the work
       plan/description
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/Extension_Request_2008
     * RESOLVED: conditional on reviews by Jos and Chris, publish FLD as
       2cnd WD

   Resolutions from Telecon 13 May 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: to close ISSUE-52 per the current version of BLD and SWC
       drafts, with the understanding that ISSUE-33 and ISSUE-39, and the
       new issue to be raised about profile mixing, are moved out of BLD
       critical path as a consequence.
     * RESOLVED: (on Axel's point 4) go with Prefix as Axel proposes
       (whitespace between prefix name and uri), as long as in the
       presentation syntax it is in a pre-amble, as a directive, so it is
       not easily confused with a fact.
     * RESOLVED: Presentation Syntax will follow option 1a (where
       Const ::= ANGLEBRACKIRI | CURIE | STRING^^ANGLEBRACKIRI |
       STRING^^CURIE )

   Resolutions from Telecon 6 May 2008 Agenda Minutes (draft)
     * RESOLVED: close ISSUE-53 as in current
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wiki/SWC

   Resolutions from Telecon 22 April 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: ISSUE-37 is not critical path for BLD.
     * RESOLVED: ISSUE-38 is not critical path for BLD.
     * RESOLVED: ISSUE-46 is not critical path for BLD.
     * RESOLVED: ISSUE-48 is not critical path for BLD.

   Resolutions from Telecon 15 April 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: That FLD be published as a FPWD with [three additional]
       Editor's Notes.
     * RESOLVED: That BLD be published as a WD with [three additional]
       Editor's Notes (same as FLD).
     * RESOLVED: Publish rif-rdf-owl (aka SWC) as WD.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-14. It is addressed in the RDF+OWL document
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-15. It is addressed in the RDF+OWL document
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-24. It is addressed in the RDF+OWL document.
       At the time the issue was opened, Core was BLD.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-16, it is addressed (as far as Phase 1) in
       FLD and BLD through the external call mechanism
     * RESOLVED: Postpone ISSUE-17, ISSUE-18, ISSUE-19 and ISSUE-20. They
       are not covered by Phase I of RIF.
     * RESOLVED: Close ISSUE-21 - unclear what it means and most likely
       subsumed by ISSUE-38.
     * RESOLVED: Remove ISSUE-26 from critical path (of BLD 1.0).

   Resolution from Telecon 8 April 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Repeal resolution regarding moving "RIF-BLD as a
       specialization of FLD" to appendix and keep that as last section
       before refs

   Resolution from Telecon 25 March 2008 Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Use fully-striped syntax for next WD (option 3 from here)

   Resolutions from Telecon 18 March 2008 Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Open an issue on terminology around
       terms/functions/predicates and include an editorial comment in WD2
       asking for feedback, but keep "atom" and "expr" for this draft.
     * RESOLVED: remove nested Foralls for BLD WD2. Maybe we'll get some
       use case some day for putting them back in.

   Resolutions from Telecon 11 March 2008 Minutes
     * RESOLVED: BLD builtins are not sensitive to order of evaluation
       (closing issue-40).
     * RESOLVED: Approve Michael's alternative proposal on lists and
       update FLD+BLD syntax/semantics accordingly to reflect that and the
       previous resolution on lists

   Resolutions from F2F9 21-22 Feb, 2008, Paris
     * RESOLVED: Create a new Document with provisional title "Data Types
       and Builtins" to contain elements common to all dialects with
       Harold and Axel as editors.
     * RESOLVED: make "specialization of FLD" sections (of BLD)
       appendices, leaving standalone sections in place, and making both
       standalone and specialization normative.
     * RESOLVED: make argument names distinct.
     * RESOLVED: We keep named arguments, explaining in BLD that: A RIF
       consumer that does not support named arguments can implement them,
       with relative ease, by treating them as positional arguments (of a
       different predicate, formed in a stable but
       implementation-dependent way) in the lexical order of the argument
       names. (Closing ISSUE-44).
     * RESOLVED: No reification in BLD. This is like WD1, except no nested
       frames. A change from 18-Feb draft: Equality, frames, subclass,
       membership are no longer terms.
     * RESOLVED: (Approach 3) Functions on error return an error element
       that is in the domain. BLD Spec does not require that predicates
       return F on error, just that they have a truth value. BLD spec
       recommends using guards with builtins, to give predictability.
       Without guards, rules may behave unpredictability on error.

   Resolution from Telecon 12 February 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Fixed interpretation functions will be represented as
       functions and fixed interpretation relations as predicates, rather
       than representing functions as predicates.

   Resolution from Telecon 29 January 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: to close issue 36 without action (that is, direct mapping
       between presentation and XML syntaxes, e.g. presented as a table).

   Resolution from Telecon 22 January 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: close issue 45 by including lists in BLD as sequences for
       both presentation and XML syntaxes.

   Resolution from Telecon 15 January 2008 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: to close issue 47 without action (i.e. equality stays in
       BLD as it is currently specified)

   Resolutions from Telecon 8 January 2007 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue-43 by including in BLD subclass formulae of
       the form a ## b. In the RDF compatibility document, ## and
       rdfs:subClassOf will be connected appropriately, i.e. whenever a ##
       b holds, a rdfs:subClassOf b is required to hold.
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue-41 by including in BLD membership formulae of
       the form c # a. In the RDF compatibility document, # and rdf:type
       will be connected appropriately, i.e. a # b holds iff a rdf:type b
       holds.

   Resolution from Telecon 11 December 2007 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Go with Axel's option C, that is using a special syntax
       to distinguish evaluated functions/predicates from logical
       functions/predicates

   Resolution from Telecon 4 December 2007 Agenda Minutes
     * RESOLVED: Close Issue 42 such that the relationship between the xml
       syntax treatment of constants and the presentation treatment of
       constants is specified in the syntax mapping table

   Resolutions from Telecon 20 November 2007
     * RESOLVED: close ISSUE-2 based on Jos' analysis
     * RESOLVED: We'll refer to XSD 1.0 instead of XSD 1.1 in our document
       for now, including a clear note that it our intention to change to
       XSD 1.1 when it becomes available, so that people can use XML 1.1.

   Resolutions from [:F2F8]
     * RESOLVED: All official (ie standard) dialects will use the main RIF
       namespace. We will support user extensions using other namespaces.
     * RESOLVED: WG asks for 6 months extension. Plans to get BLD to Last
       Call and hold 2 more F2F meetings by end of May.
     * RESOLVED: Core will be what is currently called BLD with Equality
       removed, function terms removed, and perhaps safeness, and perhaps
       slotted terms. We will not get rid of BLD. (Ignoring editorial
       issues for now) Frames stay in core.
     * RESOLVED: CLOSE ISSUE 25. Addressed by SWC document.
     * RESOLVED: close ISSUE-27 with the understanding that neither RIF
       Core nor RIF BLD will have constraint logic programming.
     * RESOLVED: close ISSUE-28 with the understanding that RIF Core (as
       defined earlier today) does not have the problems which caused us
       to raise this issue.
     * RESOLVED: to close ISSUE-35 with the understanding that this issue
       is settled in our latest published version of BLD.
     * RESOLVED: no invisible extensions (official or user extensions)
     * RESOLVED: Be nice to Michael until mid-december

   Resolutions from Telecon 23 October 2007
     * RESOLVED: Short name request for the SWC document will be
       rif-rdf-owl
     * RESOLVED: short name request for BLD will be rif-bld, with rif-core
       being republished as a trivial document referring people to
       rif-bld.

   Resolutions from Telecon 9 0ctober 2007
     * RESOLVED: the name of the dialect is RIF basic logic dialect and
       the short notation is RIF-BLD
     * RESOLVED: to split RIF Compatibility from BLD and publish 2 drafts
       simultaneously: RIF-BLD (WD 2) and RIF-COMP (WD 1)

   Resolutions from F2F7
     * RESOLVED: for BLD WD2, the root element will not be dialect
       specific
     * RESOLVED: root element is rif:Document
     * RESOLVED: To identify rules and rulesets (and other syntactic
       objects not otherwise having identifiers) we'll use rdf:about or
       rif:identifier in the next draft. This is envisioned for metadata
       and should not affect the semantics
     * RESOLVED: In WD2 there will be no indication of whether order has
       semantics in XML instance documents. The issue remains open for
       future drafts.
     * RESOLVED: In the XML syntax, we'll use full IRIs (not qnames or
       curies) for Const types, etc. Of course, XML entities can be used.
     * RESOLVED: dialect-of-authoring is identified by an IRI, which
       appears in the document as an attribute rif:dialect on the root
       element (for WD2, until we figure out extensibility)
     * RESOLVED: We will use Presentation Syntax, with minor changes, with
       a mapping table to the XML syntax.
     * RESOLVED: BLD WD2 will have structural model diagrams (which look
       like UML).
     * RESOLVED: Remove ASN from BLD WD2.
     * RESOLVED: For WD2, change structural model so that Forall, Implies,
       and Atomic are three parallel subclasses of RULE (as shown on
       Christian's diagram labeled "BLD Rule: alternative")
     * RESOLVED: The OWL Compatibility text will proceed to Last Call in
       sync with BLD.

   Resolutions from Telecon 11 September 2007
     * RESOLVED: we will have naming conventions; people edit the page to
       propose theirs (with explanation and reasons for any differences
       from what's already on page)

   Resolutions from Telecon 28 August 2007
     * RESOLVED: To include the section on frames/classification in the
       next BLD WD, suitably labelled as "under discussion" with rationale
       for/against

   Resolutions from Telecon 17 July 2007
     * RESOLVED: To better understand what RIF Core could be, create two
       task forces in RIF, one focusing on a logical dialect and the other
       one focusing on a production rules dialect
     * RESOLVED: Rename the current "RIF Core" draft: "RIF basic logic
       dialect"
     * RESOLVED: Create a "RIF basic PR dialect"

   Resolutions from [:F2F6:F2F6 2-3 June 2007]
     * RESOLVED: for [:Arch/XML_Syntax:XML syntax issue 2.1. "Should
       string values be child-elements or attributes?"], the answer is:
       Use Child Elements
     * RESOLVED: Add Frames to RIF Core (objects with slots and values,
       where slots are just binary predicates), roughly as described in
       [:Core/Slotted_Conditions]. We'll decide about the classification
       and slotted-predicates separately.

   Resolutions from Telecon 22 May 2007
     * RESOLVED: RIF Core follows OS ("overlapping sorts") as on
       http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wg/wiki/Issue-31 (resolving issue-31)
     * RESOLVED: RIF Core will require implementations to support an
       enumerated subset of F&O, used as functions (or predicates if they
       are boolean functions, like comparators), in an "evaluation" style
       (with no unbound variables as arguments).

   Resolutions from Telecon 8 May 2007
     * RESOLVED: To go with 3 (OS) or 4 (OSR), and next week we'll decide
       between 3 and 4 (cf http://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wg/wiki/Issue-31),
       closing Issue 31.

   Resolutions from Telecon 17 April 2007
     * RESOLVED: Change rif:uri to rif:iri for now, we can discuss level
       of indirection and change it later if there's consensus on a new
       name (closing Issue 30)

   Resolutions from Telecon 27 March 2007
     * RESOLVED: Publish first WD of RIF Core

   Resolutions from Telecon 20 March 2007
     * RESOLVED: Add "The examples of BNF and XML rule syntax given here
       use the unsorted version of the condition syntax and fail to
       illustrate the use of URIs for constants. This will be addressed in
       a future working draft." to the CORE WD

   Resolutions from 5th F2F Meeting
     * RESOLVED: remove link to draft DTD from Core WD1
     * RESOLVED: Remove anonymous variables from CORE WD1
     * RESOLVED: Equal aggregates 2 Terms (one association with
       multiplicity = 2 in Core condition language diagram)
     * RESOLVED: we'll keep AND and OR as 0-or-more. (it's a conventional
       treatment.)
     * RESOLVED: UML diagram for Core condition language stays in WD1 but
       with NamedElement and PSort removed
     * RESOLVED: Use diagram in
       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rif-wg/2007Feb/0134, in
       Core WD1, labeled "still under discussion"
     * RESOLVED: The concrete human-readable syntax, described in BNF, is:
       work in progress and under discussion. (It was already resolved as
       being For Illustrative Purposes Only)
     * RESOLVED: the xmlns to use for WD1 is
       "http://www.w3.org/2007/01/rif#"
     * RESOLVED: Any sort defined in Core MUST BE identified by a URI
     * RESOLVED: replace uri with rif:URI in WD1 and link to issue
     * RESOLVED: keep text as in draft, which changes datatype list from
       charter by replacing int with integer
     * RESOLVED: to publish Core WD1, if ACTIONS assigned in this meeting
       so far are done to our satisfaction. (That is, no new issues should
       arise to block publication of Core WD1)
     * RESOLVED: We'll use UML to help people visualize our abstract
       syntax. We'll say "these are graphical views of the abstract syntax
       using UML notation"

   Telecon 20 Feb Resolutions:
     * webizing will be stalled for after WD1.

   Telecon 6 February 2007 Resolutions:
     * RESOLVED: March 13 and 20 telecons will be at 4pm CET time (1500
       UTC, 11am US Eastern)
     * RESOLVED: Close issue 5
     * RESOLVED: Close issue 7
     * RESOLVED: 1st CORE WD will have only placeolders/section titles for
       "OWL Compatibility" and "RDF COmpatibility"
     * RESOLVED: 1st WD will include a MOF-UML diagram and a BNF for the
       syntax (clearly labelled as being for illustration/explanation
       purposes only)
     * RESOLVED: 1st WD will contain XML examples, stripe-skipped and
       clearly labelled as being for illustration purposes only

   Telecon 30 January 2007 Resolutions:
     * RESOLVED: we'll maintain the XML syntax(es) of RIF in the 2-step
       process, where step one will use asn06 (contingent on asn06 being
       defined as a subset of OWL Full or some other standard formalism)
       and step 2 is the precisely specified mapping from asn06 to XML
       (striped or stripe skipping or whatever).

   [:F2F4:F2F4 4-5 November 2006] Resolutions:
     * The RIF CORE will be positve Horn.
     * RIF Core will be based on current model theory with suitable
       extensions
     * RIF core must have a clear and precise syntax and semantics. Each
       standard RIF dialect must have a clear and precise syntax and
       semantics that extends RIF core.
     * For standard RIF dialects, model theories will be normative; in
       their absence it will be proof theories; in the absence of both it
       will be operational semantics.
     * The RIFWG will define useful RIF dialects in Phase 1, e.g.
       including negation, not necessarily in a Rec
     * new requirements:
     * RIF should support the ability to merge rule sets
     * RIF will support the identification of rule sets
     * RIF will use URIs as in RDF (see below)
     * RIF will provide a framework for defining RIF dialects
     * RIF must have a standard core and a limited number of standard
       dialects based upon that core
     * The implementability, semantic precision, standard components, and
       translator requirements will be treated as "general" (ie not
       specific to use cases)
     * RIF will use URIs (IRIs) in the style of RDF and OWL, using them to
       identify at least: globally named predicates, functions, datatypes,
       constants (OWL individuals, not literal values), rules, and
       rulesets.
     * Translators to and from languages which do not use URIs as names
       will need to use a name-mapping system (such as namespace prefixes)
     * RIF does not mandate any particular mapping scheme. It will provide
       a metadata vocabulary to allow translators to record the mapping if
       they choose to.
     * For example, in rule systems where the predicates refer to fields
       of java objects the metadata annotations might be used to carry the
       java fully-qualified classname and field name.
     * For RIF these are purely annotations, any use of them for carrying
       semantic information steps outside of RIF.
