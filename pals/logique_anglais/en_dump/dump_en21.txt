Scalia Sets Out the Canons of Originalism

   by Michael Lines
   More posts by Michael »

   Today, a brief interview on PBS with US Supreme Court Justice Scalia,
   who published in June Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts.
   In the interview he says the book sets out in detail the full range of
   originalism as he understands it (with the help of co-author Bryan
   Garner, Editor of Black’s Law Dictionary). The first part is a
   rationale, reportedly, and the second a how-to. To my knowledge, this
   is quite novel for a sitting judge.

   Originalism does not have much purchase in Canada, apparently, on the
   grounds that it is unnecessary to conceal the policy making of the
   courts behind elaborately wrought fig leaves (see A. M. Dodek (2009),
   46 S.C.L.R. (2d) at n. 9 for some good leads into scholarly
   acknowledgements of this reality).

       Michael thanks for the mention of my article on the policy making
       role of the Supreme Court.

       There is no doubt in my mind that Justice Scalia is an influential
       polemicist because of his adamant position on textualism and
       originalism. From my limited perspective, I see the life of law (J.
       Scalia doesn’t agree with the term “living” because paper and ink
       are inanimate objects) governed by logic and experience (“text,
       history, tradition, precedent”) but also by contextuality and
       contemporary circumstances (“purpose and consequences” Justice
       Becker). It seems to me this approach supports both intrepretative
       law and comparative law equally (with consideration given to
       limitation of statutes)? If one were to move beyond the wrought fig
       leaves, does his book have some relevant insight on how to guard
       the boundaries and preserve the democratic process by interpreting
       words alone?
       I am curious and so I guess he has sold a book.
