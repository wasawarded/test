Introduction

   Conditional logic can be used to change the way your form behaves
   depending on how it is filled out. You may want to show or hide a
   certain question for example, depending on how another question is
   answered. The same visibility logic can be applied to entire sections,
   or even pages of content. You can also use logic to determine which
   actions trigger after the form is submitted.

     * Set conditions
     * Effectively combine multiple conditions
     * Apply visibility logic to questions, sections, and pages
     * Conditionally trigger specific emails, integrations, success pages,
       and redirects
     * Combine logic with Calculations for more complex conditions

Setting a condition

   Logic can be toggled on in many places throughout the form editor. If
   you select it, you’ll see a series of dropdown menus used to set a
   condition. When this condition is met, the content will be visible, or

   and the value.

   First, you'll choose the question. Logic can be based on any field's
   answer, including Hidden fields and Calculations. If you've set up any
   Scoring on your form, you'll also see "Score" listed as an option at

     Need the condition to be case-insensitive? Use a Calculation field
     to transform the original answer to all uppercase using the UPPER()
     function. Then, target that Calculation in the logic, and set the
     value to the uppercase version of the answer. Read on to learn more
     about combining logic with Calculations.

Multiple conditions

   which part of the logic to evaluate first.

   the second and third condition together like: A or (B and C)

   Now that we've got a basic understanding of how conditions work, let's
   take a look at the different ways logic can be applied.

Visibility logic

Question visibility logic

   Perfect for a follow-up question to a specific answer, visibility logic
   is most often applied to a single question.

   To set up question visibility logic:
    1. Click the question that should be hidden or revealed.
    2. Make sure “Hide this question” is toggled off (if applicable).
    3. Toggle on “Question visibility logic."
    4. Set the condition(s) that should be met for the question to appear.
    5. Click "Done."

   Once added, you can edit your visibility logic by clicking on the
   "Configure Logic → x conditions" button below the "Question visibility
   logic" toggle.
   The "Question visibility logic" toggle is available in the
   configuration panel when you click a field. A button will appear below
   this allowing you to edit the conditions.

   If you'd like to control visibility logic for a group of questions or
   any other content on the form page, then you'll want to use section or
   page breaks instead.

Section visibility logic

   Section breaks are perfect for applying logic to a group of questions
   without changing the page. They can also cover other content, so you
   can use them to apply visibility logic to headings, paragraph text,
   images, embedded videos, etc.

   You can configure the break to add visibility logic that will apply to
   everything below this line, up until the next section or page break.

Page visibility logic

   When an entire page is "hidden," that means that it will be skipped
   completely when the user clicks the next page button (→). You can use
   visibility logic to determine which pages will be displayed or skipped.

   To add a page break, type "/break" into a blank line in the editor,
--
   editing the form.

   Configure the break to add visibility logic that will apply to
   everything below this line, up until the following page break (or the
   end of the form).

     When working with any breaks, try to avoid any redundant logic. If
     logic is applied to a page, it will automatically be applied to any
     sections and questions on that page. Repeating the same logic rules
     in those sub-sections and individual questions can make things more
     difficult to edit later. This also applies to individual questions
     inside sections.

Using visibility logic

   The most common use of logic is to conditionally show or hide certain
   questions, sections, or pages of the form.

   each question is answered, more questions and text appear.

Applying logic to actions

Emails
--
   Custom emails can be configured under After Submission → Emails. When
   adding a new email or editing an existing one, you can toggle on “Email
   Logic” at the very bottom of the page. After the form is submitted, the
   email will be sent only if the condition(s) have been met.

   the form that they’d like to sign up.

   newsletter? ... is ... Sign me up!"

   To add conditional logic to your integration:
    1. Head to After Submission → Integrations & Webhooks.
    2. To update an existing integration, find it below the list of apps,
--
       create a new one, select the app and follow the prompts.
    3. Scroll down to the very bottom of the page and toggle on “Use
       conditional logic.”
    4. Set the condition(s) that should be met in order for the
       integration to fire.

   Users on selected pricing plans have access to Dynamic Success Pages &
   Redirects. With this feature, logic can be used to determine which page
   displays after the form is submitted. An automatic redirect can
   optionally happen after that, with the same conditions applied.
--
   Quizzes are a common use case for dynamic success pages—you may want to
   show one of several possible pages of results to the submitter,
   depending on their answers. The logic could be based on their final
   Score, the result of a Calculation, or the answers themselves.

    3. Click the "Add Page +" button to set up the first page.
    4. Toggle on “Page has conditions when it should be used” to apply
       logic to this page.
    5. Design the success page, save it, and then repeat for the next
       conditional page.
--
Complex conditions

   You may need to apply some logic that is a bit more complicated than
   what you can accomplish using a few dropdown menus. On selected pricing
   plans, robust Calculation fields are available for just about anything
   you can think of—applying math to answers, transforming answers using
   functions, etc. Once you have the answer you need from the Calculation,
   you can select that field in the logic dropdown instead of the original
   question.

   form using the Calculation's result:

   You can also temporarily add a number or another identifier to the
   beginning of each repeated question's title, so that you know exactly
   what you’re looking for in the logic dropdown or the question panel.

   Slider, Score, etc).

   If you'd like to use this kind of logic with a different question type
   (like Dropdown or Scale), try using a Calculation field to turn that
   answer into a numeric value first.
--
Blank or unfinished conditions

   [Answer...] ... OR ... [Choose question]"

   If you find that some content is simply never visible, or a certain
   action never fires, double-check the logic to make sure that all of the
   conditions are set up completely (including the value for each answer).
   When a question is deleted, or its type or options get changed, this
   may affect logic that depends on that question in another part of the
   form.

   If logic is toggled on but no condition is set, then this logic will
   always fail. The same is true for conditions that are missing a value
   for the answer. If you don't need a certain condition, delete the whole
   line. If you don't need any conditions, toggle the logic setting off
   completely.
