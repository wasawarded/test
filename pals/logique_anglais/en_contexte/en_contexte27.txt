   Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits, representing
   fundamental operations in Boolean algebra. They process binary inputs
   to produce outputs, forming the basis for complex logical expressions

          + Symbolized by a bar over the variable (Â¬A or A').
          + Fundamental for negation in logical expressions.
          + Used to create more complex logic circuits by inverting
            signals.
          + Truth table: Outputs (1) for input (0) and (0) for input (1).
--
            it outputs true (1).
          + Combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.
          + Universal gate; can be used to create any other logic gate.
          + Important in digital circuit design for simplifying logic.
          + Truth table: Outputs (1) for all combinations except (1, 1).
    5. NOR gate
--
          + Combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.
          + Also a universal gate; can be used to construct any other
            logic gate.
          + Useful in creating circuits that require a default false
            state.
