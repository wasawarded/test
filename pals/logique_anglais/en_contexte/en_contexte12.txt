   instructions that change program state. However, imperative programming
   is just one programming paradigm. This course introduces two other
   programming paradigms: functional and logic programming. Logic
   programming is based on first-order logic, while functional programming
   is based on the lambda calculus. Students will learn the basic
   theoretical foundations as well as how to program in two relevant
