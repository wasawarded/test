   In logic, disjunction, also known as logical disjunction or logical or
   or logical addition or inclusive disjunction, is a logical connective
   typically notated as
--
   {\displaystyle \lor } and read aloud as "or". For instance, the English
   language sentence "it is sunny or it is warm" can be represented in
   logic using the disjunctive formula
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
   displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mi>S</mi> <mo>∨</mo> <mi>W</mi>
--
   {\displaystyle W} abbreviates "it is warm".

   In classical logic, disjunction is given a truth functional semantics
   according to which a formula

   When it is necessary to clarify whether inclusive or exclusive or is
   intended, English speakers sometimes uses the phrase and/or. In terms
   of logic, this phrase is identical to or, but makes the inclusion of
   both being true explicit.

   In logic and related fields, disjunction is customarily notated with an
   infix operator
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
--
   {\displaystyle \vert \!\vert } in many programming languages. The
   English word or is sometimes used as well, often in capital letters. In
   Jan Łukasiewicz's prefix notation for logic, the operator is
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
   displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mi>A</mi> </mstyle> </mrow>

   In the semantics of logic, classical disjunction is a truth functional
   operation which returns the truth value true unless both of its
   arguments are false. Its semantic entry is standardly given as

   [edit]

   In classical logic systems where logical disjunction is not a
   primitive, it can be defined in terms of the primitive and (

   Similar deviations from classical logic have been noted in cases such
   as free choice disjunction and simplification of disjunctive
   antecedents, where certain modal operators trigger a conjunction-like
