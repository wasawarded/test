   The logic for this is as follows. On the face of it, there is no
   rational way to explain the halachah of hazamah. For why should we

   How would Rav Ashi respond to this argument? Perhaps Rav Ashi would say
   that you have no right to make any logical extensions from a law that
   is clearly not governed by logic. This viewpoint can be compared to the
   view that, ironically, is expressed by Rava back on 27a. The Gemara
   there explores the question of whether we apply the status of a witness

   Rava there states that we do not apply this false witness’s

   above) the whole concept of hazamah defies logic, we cannot treat it as
