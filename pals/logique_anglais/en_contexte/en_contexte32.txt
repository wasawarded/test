   If you would like to learn more about Active Logic, we suggest you
   start with one of our primers.

   Our acronym ALMECOM stands for Active Logic, Metacognitive Computation,
   and Mind. Active Logic is a time-sensitive formalism that has been
   developed with real-world applications and their challenges in mind.
   Active logic explicitly reasons in time, and incorporates a history of
   its reasoning as it runs. This characteristic makes active logic more
   flexible than traditional AI systems and therefore more suitable for
   commonsense, real-world reasoning.

   One important strategy that we employ in active logic is metareasoning.
   Because active logic tracks its reasoning, it is able to reason about
   its own inferences, and thereby recognize and recover from errors.
