   programmable elements (shown as a fuse) connect both the true and
   complemented inputs to the AND gates. These AND gates, also known as
   product terms, are ORed together to form a sum-of-products logic array.

   A programmable logic device (PLD) is an electronic component used to
   build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike digital logic constructed
   using discrete logic gates with fixed functions, the function of a PLD
   is undefined at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in
   a circuit it must be programmed to implement the desired function.^[1]
   Compared to fixed logic devices, programmable logic devices simplify
   the design of complex logic and may offer superior performance.^[2]
   Unlike for microprocessors, programming a PLD changes the connections
   made between the gates in the device.

   PLDs can broadly be categorised into, in increasing order of
   complexity, simple programmable logic devices (SPLDs), comprising
   programmable array logic, programmable logic array and generic array
   logic; complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs); and
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

   was programmed by altering the metal layer during the production of the
   IC. The TMS2000 had up to 17 inputs and 18 outputs with 8 JK flip-flops
   for memory. TI coined the term programmable logic array (PLA) for this
   device.^[4]

   In 1971, General Electric Company (GE) was developing a programmable
   logic device based on the new programmable read-only memory (PROM)
   technology. This experimental device improved on IBM's ROAM by allowing
   multilevel logic. Intel had just introduced the floating-gate UV EPROM
   so the researcher at GE incorporated that technology. The GE device was
   the first erasable PLD ever developed, predating the Altera EPLD by
   over a decade. GE obtained several early patents on programmable logic
   devices.^[5]^[6]^[7]

   This was more popular than the TI part but the cost of making the metal
   mask limited its use. The device is significant because it was the
   basis for the field programmable logic array produced by Signetics in
   1975, the 82S100. (Intersil actually beat Signetics to market but poor
   yield doomed their part.)^[8]^[9]

   In 1974 GE entered into an agreement with Monolithic Memories (MMI) to
   develop a mask-programmable logic device incorporating the GE
   innovations. The device was named programmable associative logic array
   or PALA. The MMI 5760 was completed in 1976 and could implement
   multilevel or sequential circuits of over 100 gates. The device was

   A programmable logic array (PLA) has a programmable AND gate array,
   which links to a programmable OR gate array, which can then be
   conditionally complemented to produce an output. A PLA is similar to a

   PAL devices have arrays of transistor cells arranged in a "fixed-OR,
   programmable-AND" plane used to implement "sum-of-products" binary
   logic equations for each of the outputs in terms of the inputs and
   either synchronous or asynchronous feedback from the outputs.

   MMI introduced a breakthrough device in 1978, the programmable array
   logic or PAL. The architecture was simpler than that of Signetics' FPLA
   because it omitted the programmable OR array. This made the parts
   faster, smaller and cheaper. They were available in 20-pin 300-mil DIP

   nanosecond devices.

   An improvement on the PAL was the generic array logic device, or GAL,
   invented by Lattice Semiconductor in 1985. This device has the same
   logical properties as the PAL but can be erased and reprogrammed. The
   GAL is very useful in the prototyping stage of a design, when any bugs
   in the logic can be corrected by reprogramming. GALs are programmed and
   reprogrammed using a PAL programmer, or, in the case of chips that
   support it, by using the in-circuit programming technique.

   Lattice GALs combine CMOS and electrically erasable (E^2) floating gate
   technology for a high-speed, low-power logic device. A similar device
   called a PEEL (programmable electrically erasable logic) was introduced
   by the International CMOS Technology (ICT) corporation.

   Sometimes GAL chips are referred as simple programmable logic device
   (SPLD), analogous to complex programmable logic device (CPLD) below.

CPLDs

   PALs and GALs are available only in small sizes, equivalent to a few
   hundred logic gates. For bigger logic circuits, complex PLDs or CPLDs
   can be used. These contain the equivalent of several PALs linked by
   programmable interconnections, all in one integrated circuit. CPLDs can
   replace thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of logic gates.

   Some CPLDs are programmed using a PAL programmer, but this method

   then feed it with a serial data stream from a personal computer. The
   CPLD contains a circuit that decodes the data stream and configures the
   CPLD to perform its specified logic function. Some manufacturers, such
   as Altera and Atmel (now Microchip), use JTAG to program CPLDs
   in-circuit from .JAM files.

   FPGAs use a grid of logic gates, and once stored, the data doesn't
   change, similar to that of an ordinary gate array. The term
   field-programmable means the device is programmed by the customer, not

   The difference between FPGAs and CPLDs is that FPGAs are internally
   based on look-up tables (LUTs), whereas CPLDs form the logic functions
   with sea-of-gates (e.g. sum of products). CPLDs are meant for simpler
   designs while FPGAs are meant for more complex designs. In general,
   CPLDs are a good choice for wide combinational logic applications,
   whereas FPGAs are more suitable for large state machines such as
   microprocessors.

   PLDs are being sold now that contain a microprocessor with a fixed
   function (the so-called core) surrounded by programmable logic. These
   devices let designers concentrate on adding new features to designs
   without having to worry about making the microprocessor work. Also, the

   A PLD is a combination of a logic device and a memory device. The
   memory is used to store the pattern that was given to the chip during
   programming. Most of the methods for storing data in an integrated

   Many PAL programming devices accept input in a standard file format,
   commonly referred to as 'JEDEC files'. They are analogous to software
   compilers. The languages used as source code for logic compilers are
   called hardware description languages, or HDLs.^[1]

   A device programmer is used to transfer the Boolean logic pattern into
   the programmable device. In the early days of programmable logic, every
   PLD manufacturer also produced a specialized device programmer for its
   family of logic devices. Later, universal device programmers came onto
   the market that supported several logic device families from different
   manufacturers. Today's device programmers usually can program common
   PLDs (mostly PAL/GAL equivalents) from all existing manufacturers.
   Common file formats used to store the Boolean logic pattern (fuses) are
   JEDEC, Altera POF (programmable object file), or Xilinx BITstream.^[17]
