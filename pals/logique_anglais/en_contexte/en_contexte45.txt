   The main discipline studying logical reasoning is called logic. It is
   divided into formal and informal logic, which study formal and informal
   logical reasoning.^[8]^[9]^[10] Traditionally, logical reasoning was
   primarily associated with deductive reasoning studied by formal
   logic.^[11] But in a wider sense, it also includes forms of
   non-deductive reasoning, such as inductive, abductive, and analogical
   reasoning.^[12]^[13]^[14]

   starts from the premises and arrives at the conclusion.^[18]^[24] But
   the terms "argument" and "inference" are often used interchangeably in
   logic. The purpose of arguments is to convince a person that something
   is the case by providing reasons for this belief.^[25]^[26] Many
   arguments in natural language do not explicitly state all the premises.
--
   The rules governing deductive reasoning are often expressed formally as
   logical systems for assessing the correctness of deductive arguments.
   Aristotelian logic is one of the earliest systems and was treated as
   the canon of logic in the Western world for over two thousand years. It
   is based on syllogisms, like concluding that "Socrates is a mortal"
   from the premises "Socrates is a man" and "all men are
   mortal".^[44]^[45]^[46] The currently dominant system is known as
   classical logic and covers many additional forms of inferences besides
   syllogisms. So-called extended logics are based on classical logic and
   introduce additional rules of inference for specific domains. For
   example, modal logic can be used to reason about what is possible and
   what is necessary. Temporal logic can be used to draw inferences about
   what happened before, during, and after an event.^[47]^[48]^[49]
   Classical logic and its extensions rest on a set of basic logical
   intuitions accepted by most logicians. They include the law of excluded
   middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of explosion,

   Deductive reasoning plays a central role in formal logic and
   mathematics.^[1] In mathematics, it is used to prove mathematical
   theorems based on a set of premises, usually called axioms. For

   conclusion. Fallacies often appear to be correct on the first
   impression and thereby seduce people into accepting and using them. In
   logic, the term "fallacy" does not mean that the conclusion is false.
   Instead, it only means that some kind of error was committed on the way
   to reaching the conclusion. An argument can be a fallacy even if, by a
   fortuitous accident, the conclusion is true. Outside the field of
   logic, the term "fallacy" is sometimes used in a slightly different
   sense for a false belief or theory and not for an
   argument.^[32]^[96]^[97]

   thinking. In this sense, it is roughly equivalent to critical thinking
   and includes the capacity to select and apply the appropriate rules of
   logic to specific situations.^[110] It encompasses a great variety of
   abilities besides drawing conclusions from premises. Examples are to
   understand a position, to generate and evaluate reasons for and against
