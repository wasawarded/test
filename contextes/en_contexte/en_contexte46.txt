   Logical consequence (also entailment or implication) is a fundamental
   concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements
   that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more
   statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is
--
   involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its
   premises? and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of
   premises?^[1] All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts
   of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical
   truth.^[2]
--
   explain with formal proof and models of interpretation.^[1] A sentence
   is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given
   language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any
   personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if
   every sentence in the set is true.^[3]
--
   The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical
   consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of proofs and via
   models. The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called
   (its) proof theory whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is
   called (its) model theory.^[4]
