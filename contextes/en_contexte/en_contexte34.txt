   involves.

   Active Logic is a formalism that has been developed with real-world
   applications and their challenges in mind. Motivating its design is the
   thought that one of the factors that supports the flexibility of human
   reasoning is that it takes place step-wise, in time. Active Logic is
   one of a family of inference engines (step-logics) that explicitly
   reason in time, and incorporate a history of their reasoning as they
   run. This characteristic makes Active Logic systems more flexible than
   traditional AI systems and therefore more suitable for commonsense,
   real-world reasoning. In this report we mainly will survey recent
--
   concentrate on topic-specific search engines, focused crawling, and
   finally will propose an Information Integration Environment, based on
   the Active Logic framework.
