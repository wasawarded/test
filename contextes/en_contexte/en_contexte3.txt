   example is in the SAT-based analysis of quantification information flow
   programs, where efficient methods for conditioned model counting using
   d-DNNF were exploited [5]. Another example is the Probabilistic Logic
   Programming framework, ProbLog [6]. Here, the model counters were used
   to provide probabilistic inference for targeted queries compiled from a
   given logic program.

   Finally, since the original publication of this work in 2012 by Muise

   For stable model counting, every model represented by the compiled
   theory must be stable: a notion in logic programming that stipulates
   that the truth of atoms cannot be self supporting given the logic
   program’s rules [9]. To accommodate for stable models, DSHARP was
   modified to include an internal propagator that rules out any model
