   In a computer, most of the electronic circuits are made up logic gates.
   Logic gates are used to create a circuit that performs calculations,
   data storage or shows off object-oriented programming especially the
   power of inheritance. Logic gates can also be constructed using vacuum
   tubes, electromagnetic elements like optics, molecule etc.

What is Logic Gate?

   A Logic gate is an elementary building block of any digital circuits.
   It takes one or two inputs and produces output based on those inputs.
   Outputs may be high (1) or low (0). Logic gates are implemented using
   diodes or transistors. There are seven basic logic gates defined, these
   are:
    1. AND gate,

Conclusion

   Logic gates are basic building components of digital circuits necessary
   to design complex systems. They are used to perform logical operations.
   It is important to understanding the working and combination of these
   gates in order to design circuits that perform tasks correctly and
   efficiently. Logic gates can help develop a solid foundation in digital
   electronics and pave the way for exploring more advanced topics.

Frequently Asked Questions on Logic Gates – FAQs

     * Two Level Implementation of Logic Gates
       The term "two-level logic" refers to a logic design that uses no

       mean that the entire design will only have two logic gates, but it
       does mean that the single path from input to output will only have
       two logic gates. In two-level logic
