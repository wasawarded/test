    be the habits of thought enforced by the current technological scheme
       that will have most (or most immediately) to say in the current
   systematization of facts. The working logic of the current state of the
   industrial arts will necessarily insinuate itself as the logical scheme
      which must, of course, effectually govern the interpretation and
--
    limitations of workmanship. And when and in so far as the habituation
   so enforced in the traffic of workday life goes into effect as a scheme
    of logic governing the quest of knowledge, such principles as have by
   habit found acceptance as being conventionally salutary and conclusive
    in the pecuniary conduct of affairs will necessarily leave their mark
--
         framework of the modern system of learning; but rather the
   preconceptions of that disciplined workmanship that has been instructed
      in the logic of the modern technology and sophisticated with much
    experience in a civilization in whose scheme of life pecuniary canons
                               are definitive.
