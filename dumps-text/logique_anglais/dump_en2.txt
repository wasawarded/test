Privacy Policy

Introduction

   AIG Europe S.A. (“AIG Ireland”, “we/us”) together with other affiliates
   and subsidiary companies of American International Group, Inc.
   (collectively called “AIG”) value your trust in us and are committed to
   handling Personal Information (defined below) appropriately in
   accordance with applicable laws.

   This is our main Privacy Policy which describes how we use Personal
   Information that we collect as part of our core business activities.

   References to "you" or "your" means any individual with whom we have a
   relationship, including policyholders, insureds or claimants under an
   insurance policy, commercial insurance brokers, appointed
   representatives, witnesses or another individual with whom we have a
   relationship or users of AIG Digital Services.

   This Privacy Policy will be supplemented by additional privacy policies
   tailored to our specific relationships with you where this is useful to
   provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal
   Information.

   The purpose of this Policy is to explain what Personal Information we
   collect, access, use, store, transfer and/or disclose (together,
   “process”), the reasons we process your Personal Information, to whom
   Personal Information is disclosed and your rights under the relevant
   laws.

   We use the words Personal Information to describe information about you
   and other individuals (for example, your partner or other members of
   your family), and from which you or they are identifiable.

   Our aim is responsible and secure handling of Personal Information,
   balancing the benefits of activities like research and data analytics
   to improve our products and service delivery, with our other
   commitments, including fairness, transparency and non-discrimination.

   Personal Information is obtained from a variety of sources, including:
     * application, proposal and claim forms, and other forms;
     * telephone calls, emails, meetings and other communications;
     * service providers, brokers and agents, claims investigators,
       witnesses, medical professionals, driver and vehicle licensing
       authorities, credit reference agencies, your employer, and other
       third parties;
     * this website (the “Site”);
     * the software applications made available by us on computers, smart
       phones and other mobile devices (the “Apps”); and
     * our social media pages, other social media content, tools and
       applications (our “Social Media Content”).

   Unless otherwise indicated, the AIG Digital Services are only for use
   by legally competent adults. Minors (i.e. individuals under the age of
   eighteen (18)), and those without legal competency should not provide
   Personal Information through the AIG Digital Services themselves but
   rather via appropriately authorised agents, guardians or legal
   advisors.

   Personal Information may be provided to us by you directly or by a
   third party.  For example, an insurance policyholder may provide
   Personal Information about you so that you can benefit under their
   insurance policy.

   Please note:

   By providing us with Personal Information about another individual, you
   represent that you have (unless we agreed otherwise, in writing): (a)
   informed the individual about the content of this Privacy Policy and
   any other applicable privacy notices provided to you; and (b) obtained
   their permission (where required by, and in such manner as required by,
   applicable laws) to share their Personal Information with us in
   accordance with this Privacy Policy and other applicable privacy
   notices.

   other information resources, third-party commercial information
   sources, and information from our group companies and business
   partners). We will use any such supplemental information in accordance
   with applicable law (including obtaining your consent where required)

(BUTTON) Why we process Personal Information and the legal justification for
doing so

   We use Personal Information to carry out our business activities.  The
   purposes for which we use your Personal Information will differ based
   on our relationship, including the type of communications between us
   and the services we provide. Personal Information will be used for
   different purposes if you are a policyholder, insured or claimant under
   an insurance policy, a commercial insurance broker or appointed
   representative, a witness or another individual with whom we have a
   relationship.

   Legal Justification

   Data protection law seeks to ensure that the way Personal Information
   is processed is fair. To comply with the law, we need to tell you the
   legal justification (sometimes also referred to as a legal or lawful
   basis) we rely on for using your Personal Information. While the law
   provides several legal justifications, the table below describes the
   main legal justifications that apply to our purposes for using Personal
   Information.

   We may be required to obtain Personal Information from you to comply
   with applicable legal requirements, and certain Personal Information
   may be needed to enable us to fulfil the terms of our contract with you
   (or someone else), or in preparation of entering into a contract with
   you (or someone else), or for pursuing a right and/or legitimate
   interest of ours or of third parties. We may inform you of this at the
   time that we are obtaining the Personal Information from you.  In these
   circumstances, if you do not provide the relevant Personal Information
   to us, we may not be able to provide our products or services to you.
   If you would like further information, please contact us using the
   details below (see section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal
   Information?’).

   Where we rely on our legitimate business interests or the legitimate
   interests of a third party to justify the purposes for using your
   Personal Information, those legitimate interests will be set out in a
   supplemental privacy notice (which is tailored to our relationship with
   you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we
   collect and use Personal Information), but in any event our legitimate
   interests will usually be:
     * pursuit of our commercial activities and objectives, or those of a
       third party (for example, by carrying out direct marketing);
     * compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, and
       any guidelines, standards and codes of conduct (for example, by
       carrying out background checks or otherwise preventing, detecting
       or investigating fraud or money laundering);
     * improvement and development of our business operations and service
       offering, or those of a third party;
     * protection of our assets, information, business, shareholders,
       employees and customers, or those of a third party (for example,
       ensuring IT network and information security, enforcing claims,
       including debt collection);
     * to keep our IT network/systems secure, prevent/detect crime and
       ascertain compliance with internal roles for using the system; and
     * analysing competition in the market for our services (for example,
       by carrying out research, including market research).

   We may need to collect, use and disclose Personal Information in
   connection with matters of important public interest, for instance when
   complying with our obligations under anti-money laundering and
   terrorist financing laws and regulations, and other laws and
   regulations aimed at preventing financial crime.  In these cases, the
   legal justification for our use of Personal Information is that the use
   is necessary for matters of public interest. Additional justifications
   may also apply depending on the circumstances.

   Sensitive/Special Categories of Personal Information

   For more sensitive/special categories of Personal Information we will
   rely on either:
     * your explicit consent; or
     * one or more of the other legal justifications set out in the table
       below (which apply to all Personal Information) and typically one
       of the following additional justifications which are only required
       where we process sensitive/special categories of Personal
       Information (however other legal justifications may be available):
          + the use is necessary for the establishment, exercise or
            defence of legal claims, or whenever courts are acting in
            their judicial capacity (for example, when a court issues a
            court order requiring the processing of Personal Information);
          + the use is necessary for reasons of substantial public
            interest on the basis of EEA/member state or UK law (as
            applicable); or
          + the use is necessary for the purposes of preventive or
            occupational medicine, medical diagnosis or the provision of
            health or social care or treatment.

   These more sensitive/special categories of Personal Information include
   Personal Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
   opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
   membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the
   purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
   health or data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual
   orientation.

   Processing of Personal Information relating to criminal convictions and
   offences is subject to the requirements of applicable law and may
   require an additional legal justification beyond those identified in
   the table below.

(BUTTON) How do we use Personal Information?

   We use Personal Information to carry out our business activities.  The
   purposes for which we use your Personal Information will differ based
   on our relationship, including the type of communications between us
   and the services we provide. Personal Information will be used for
   different purposes if you are a policyholder, insured or claimant under
   an insurance policy, a commercial insurance broker or appointed
   representative, a witness or another individual with whom we have a
   relationship.

   We may where required obtain your consent for the collection, use,
   disclosure and/or otherwise processing your Personal Information as
   described in this Privacy Policy through other relevant documentation
   (such as through application forms). Any consent given by you will not
   be affected by the termination or expiry of your insurance policy.

   Where we rely on your consent to collect, use, disclose or process any
   of your Personal Information you may withdraw your consent at any time
   by contacting us (please see section titled ‘Who to contact about your
   Personal Information’ in this Privacy Policy for the contact details).
   We will effect your withdrawal of consent as soon as technically
   feasible and in any event within a reasonable period after receiving
   your request. We will, thereafter, cease to collect, use or disclose
   your Personal Information, unless required under applicable laws.

   Should you withdraw your consent, you will not suffer any detriment,
   however, we may not be able to provide you with the services that you
   have requested and we will inform you of the consequences of such
   withdrawal of consent where applicable.

(BUTTON) How do we use Personal Information to detect, investigate and
prevent fraud?

   We are committed to detecting and preventing fraud, and other financial
   crime.  We take this commitment very seriously and use Personal
   Information in a number of ways for this purpose.

   For example, if relevant to our relationship with you, we will (where
   permitted by applicable law):
     * submit your Personal Information (including details of any claims
       you make, for example, details of injuries) so that they appear on
       registers of claims which are shared between different insurance
       providers;
     * search registers of previous claims when assessing a claim; and
     * share your Personal Information with other insurers, fraud
       prevention agencies databases, and law enforcement agencies.

   For further details, please see the section below ‘Who is Personal
   Information shared with?' or please contact us using the details
   provided below (see section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal
   Information?’).

(BUTTON) Are automated decisions made using Personal Information?

   Sometimes, as part of our business operations, decisions about you are
   taken using automated computer software and systems.  These decisions
   do not involve human input, and the software and systems apply
   pre-defined logic programming and criteria to make a decision and
   assess how we deal with you in connection with the provision of
   services.

   For example, we sometimes use automated decision making as part of a
   process to:
     * decide whether a travel insurance claim should be paid as requested
       (for example, if pre-specified criteria are met by responses that
       you provide, the claim will be paid automatically without the need
       for additional human intervention); or
     * identify known pre-existing medical conditions in connection with
       our travel insurance business to decide whether we can offer
       insurance to you and on what terms; or
     * generally, assess your eligibility for insurance using a
       pre-defined set of criteria.

   We provide you with more information in relation to any automated
   decision processes before or at the time that we intend to make
   decisions in this way. You have the right in certain circumstances not
   to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated
   processing. Please see the section below 'What are your Personal
   Information rights?' below for further details of this right.

   Where required to do so, we will seek your consent prior to collecting
   your Personal Information for the abovementioned processes.

(BUTTON) Who is responsible for Personal Information?

   The AIG group comprises a number of companies, including, but not
   limited to, the AIG parent company American International Group, Inc.,
   American International Group UK Limited and AIG Europe SA country
   branches in Europe.

   policyholder, the AIG group company that underwrites your insurance
   policy will be the main company responsible for your Personal
   Information, the controller. Depending on our relationship with you, we
   will provide further information in a supplemental privacy notice
   tailored to our relationship.

   arrangement with AIG (for example, a policy taken out by your
   employer), Personal Information relating to the administration of that
   insurance policy or service may be shared with that other party.

   Personal Information may also be shared by you on message boards, chat,
   profile pages and blogs, and other AIG Digital Services to which you
   are able to post information and materials (including, without

   Personal Information by the UK Government and / or the European
   Commission.

   For example, we may transfer Personal Information in order to process
   international travel insurance claims and provide emergency medical
   assistance services when you are abroad.  We may transfer information
   internationally to our group companies, service providers, business
   partners, government or public authorities, and other third parties.

   When making these transfers, we will take steps to ensure that your
   Personal Information is adequately protected and transferred in
   accordance with the requirements of data protection law, including by:
     * relying on the fact that a country has been approved by the
       European Commission or the UK Government (as applicable) as
       providing adequate protection; or
     * using data transfer agreements in the form approved by the European
       Commission and, where applicable, the UK Government and permitted
       under Article 46 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation or
       the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (the relevant data
       protection law).

   If there is no data transfer agreement in place, we may use other
   mechanisms recognised by the relevant data protection law as ensuring
   an adequate level of protection for Personal Information transferred
   outside the EEA/UK (for example, the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy
   Framework between the European Commission and USA or any framework that
   may replace it in the future).

   This typically involves the use of standard contractual clauses
   approved or mandated by the relevant data protection authority or
   appropriate data transfer agreement.

   For further information about these transfers and to request details of
   the safeguards in place, please contact us using the details below (see
   section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal Information?’).

(BUTTON) How do we keep Personal Information secure and maintain data
integrity?

   AIG uses reasonable and appropriate technical, physical, legal and
   organisational measures, which comply with data protection laws to keep
   Personal Information secure, taking into account the nature, scope,
   context, complexity, risks and purposes of the processing of Personal
   Information.

   We have implemented appropriate data protection policies that provide
   for the aforementioned security measures. We also train our colleagues
   regularly on data protection and information security.

   As most of the Personal Information we hold is stored electronically we
   have implemented appropriate IT security measures to ensure this
   Personal Information is kept secure.  For example, we may use
   anti-virus protection systems, firewalls, and data encryption
   technologies.  We have procedures in place at our premises to keep any
   hard copy records physically secure.  AIG also has a dedicated team
   that monitors the global AIG network for any potential cyber and IT
   security threats. We also train our staff regularly on data protection
   and information security.

   When AIG engages a third party (including our service providers) to
   collect or otherwise process Personal Information on our behalf, the
   third party will be selected carefully and required to use appropriate
   security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of
   Personal Information.

   Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or electronic
   data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have
   reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
   (for example, if you feel that the security of any Personal Information
   you might have sent to us has been compromised), please immediately
   notify us (see section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal
   Information?’).

   AIG will take reasonable steps designed to ensure that the Personal
   Information processed is reliable for its intended use and is accurate
   and complete for carrying out the purposes described in this Policy.

(BUTTON) Do we record calls and monitor email communications with us?

   We may record telephone calls with you so that we can:
     * improve the standard of service that we provide by providing our
       staff with feedback and training;
     * address queries, concerns or complaints;
     * prevent, detect and investigate crime, including fraud and money
       laundering, and analyse and manage other commercial risks; and
     * comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

   In addition, we monitor electronic communications between us (for
   example, emails) to protect you, our business and IT infrastructure,
   and third parties including by:
     * identifying and dealing with inappropriate communications; and
     * looking for and removing any viruses, or other malware, and
       resolving any other information security issues.

(BUTTON) How long do we keep Personal Information for?

   AIG may store Personal Information either electronically (including in
   the cloud) or in paper form. We will keep Personal Information for as
   long as is necessary for the purposes for which we collect it.  The
   precise period will depend on what the information is and purpose for
   which it is being processed.  In addition, as a regulated financial
   services institution, there are laws and regulations that apply to us
   which set minimum periods for retention of Personal Information. We
   will provide you with further information if appropriate to give you a
   full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information.

   For example:
     * Where we hold Personal Information to comply with a legal or
       regulatory obligation, we will keep the information for at least as
       long as is required to comply with that obligation.
     * Where we hold Personal Information in order to provide a product or
       service (such as an insurance policy and claims handling), we will
       keep the information for at least as long as we provide the product
       or service, and for a number of years after expiry of the policy
       and the handling of any related claim.

   The number of years varies depending on the nature of the product or
   service provided – for example, for certain insurance policies it may
   be necessary to keep the Personal Information for several years after
   the expiry of the policy. Among other reasons, we retain the
   information in order to respond to any queries or concerns that may be
   raised at a later date with respect to the policy or the handling of a
   claim.  Typically, for consumer insurance products, the retention
   period is seven 7 years.

   Electronic files stored on storage media devices are securely disposed
   by wiping and erasing the device and, thereafter, degaussing and
   shredding the device. Physical files are disposed of by secure
   shredding and pulping.

   For further information about the period of time for which we retain
   your Personal Information, please contact us using the details below
   (see section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal Information?’).

(BUTTON) How can you tell us about your marketing preferences?

   We will provide you with regular opportunities to tell us your
   marketing preferences, including in our communications to you.

   In certain countries, we may be required to obtain your consent for the
   use of your personal details for direct marketing purposes.

   To tell us your marketing preferences, and to change your preferences
   if required, you can contact us by:

   email: unsub.ie@aig.com

   writing: AIG Europe S.A., Ireland Branch, 30 North Wall Quay,
   International Financial Service Centre, Dublin 1 ; DO1 R8H7

   In addition, you can also opt-out of receiving marketing communications
   as follows:
     * Receiving email messages and text messages from us:  If you no
       longer want to receive marketing emails or text messages from AIG,
       you can opt-out of receiving these marketing-related messages by
       clicking on the link to “unsubscribe” provided in each email
       message, following the stop instructions in a text message, or by

     * Receiving telephone communications and postal mail from us:  If you
       no longer want to receive marketing via telephone communications or

       also be able to contact a "Do not call" registry in your country to

       by telephone, although we may still contact you if you are listed
       on such a register if you have given your consent.
     * Sharing of your Personal Information with our group companies for
       their marketing purposes:  With your consent we may share your
       Personal Information with our group companies for their own
       marketing purposes.  If you change your mind, you may opt-out of
       this sharing by contacting us using the addresses above.
     * Sharing of your Personal Information with selected third-party
       partners for their marketing purposes:  If you have provided your
       consent we may share your Personal Information with our third-party
       partners for their own marketing purposes. If you change your mind,
       you may opt-out of this sharing by contacting us using the
       addresses above.

   We aim to comply with your opt-out requests within a reasonable time
   period and in any event within any period prescribed by law.  Please
   note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to
   remove your Personal Information from the databases of third parties
   with whom we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e. to
   those to whom we have already provided your Personal Information as of
   the date on which we respond to your opt-out request).

   Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing
   communications from us, we may still send you other important service
   and administration communications relating to the services which we
   provide to you, and you cannot opt-out from these service and
   administration communications.

(BUTTON) What are your Personal Information rights?

   The following is a summary of the data protection rights available to
   individuals in Ireland in connection with their Personal Information.
   These rights may only apply in certain jurisdictions and/or
   circumstances and are subject to certain legal limitations or
   exemptions.

   If you wish to exercise your rights, please contact us using the
   details below (see section below ‘Who to contact about your Personal
   Information?’).
                                 Right                               Description

   Right of access to Personal Information

   The right to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about
   you and information about how we use it.

   This right is applicable at all times when we hold your Personal
   Information (subject to certain exemptions)

   Right to rectification of Personal Information

   The right to ask us to correct Personal Information we hold about you
   where it is incorrect or incomplete.

   This right is applicable at all times when we hold your Personal
   Information (subject to certain exemptions).

   Right to erasure of Personal Information

   This right is sometimes referred to as 'the right to be forgotten'.
   This is the right to request that your Personal Information be deleted
   or removed from our systems and records. However, this right only
   applies in certain circumstances.

   Examples of when this right applies to Personal Information we hold
   include (subject to certain exemptions):
     * when we no longer need the Personal Information for the purpose we
       collected it;

     * if you withdraw consent to our use of your information and no other
       legal justification supports our continued use of your information;
     * if you object to the way we use your information and we have no
       overriding grounds to continue using it;
     * if we have used your Personal Information unlawfully; and
     * if the Personal Information needs to be erased for compliance with
       law.

   Right to restrict processing of Personal Information

   The right to request that we suspend our use of your Personal
   Information. This right only applies in certain circumstances.

   Where we suspend our use of your Personal Information, we will still be
   permitted to store your Personal Information, but any other use of this
   information while our use is suspended will require your consent,
   subject to certain exemptions.

   You can exercise this right if:
     * you think that the Personal Information we hold about you is not
       accurate, but this only applies for a period of time that allows us
       to consider if your Personal Information is in fact inaccurate;
     * the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your
       Personal Information and request the restriction of its use
       instead;
     * we no longer need the Personal Information for the purposes we have
       used it to date, but the Personal Information is required by you in
       connection with legal claims; or
     * you have objected to our processing of the Personal Information and
       we are considering whether our reasons for processing override your
       objection.

   Right to data portability

   This right allows you to obtain your Personal Information in a format
   which enables you to transfer that Personal Information to another
   organisation, if this is technically feasible.

   However, this right will only apply:
     * to Personal Information you provided to us;
     * where we have justified our use of your Personal Information based
       on:
          + your consent; or
          + the fulfilment by us of a contract with you; and
     * if our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.

   Right to object to processing of Personal Information

   You have the right to object to our use of your Personal Information in
   certain circumstances.

   We may continue to use your Personal Information, despite your
   objection, where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so or we
   need to use your Personal Information in connection with any legal
   claims.

   You can object to the use of your Personal Information for direct
   marketing purposes at any time (including if we are carrying out
   profiling related to direct marketing).

   Right to withdraw consent to processing of Personal Information

   Where we have relied upon your consent to process your Personal
   Information, you have the right to withdraw that consent.

   Right to complain to the relevant data protection regulator



   If you think that we have processed your Personal Information in a
   manner that is not in accordance with data protection law, in
   accordance with applicable law, you may be able to complain to the data
   protection regulator whether either the alleged infringement took
   place, or where you live or work.

   This right applies at any time.

   Rights relating to automated decision making and profiling

   The right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on
   automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision
   produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you.

   However, this right only applies in certain circumstances.

   This right is not applicable if:
     * we need to make the automated decision in order to enter into or
       fulfil a contract with you;
     * we are authorised by law to take the automated decision; or
     * you have provided your explicit consent to the decision being taken
       in this way using your Personal Information.

(BUTTON) What user and device data do we collect through AIG Digital
Services?

   User and device data is collected when you use AIG Digital Services.
   This information may not reveal your specific identity and therefore
   may not be Personal Information which is used as described in the
   earlier sections of this Privacy Policy.

   Examples of this type of user and device data are:
     * internet browser and electronic device information;
     * operating system and platform;
     * app usage data;
     * information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other
       technologies (further details being described in our Cookie
       Policy.);
     * demographic information; and
     * data grouped together so that it is not possible to link the data
       to a particular individual, known as aggregated data.

   We and our third-party service providers may collect user and device
   data in a variety of ways when you use AIG Digital Services, including:
   Method of data collection Examples

   Through your internet browser or electronic device

   Certain information is collected by most websites or automatically
   through your electronic device, such as your IP address (i.e. your
   computer’s address on the internet), screen resolution, operating
   system type (Windows or Mac) and version, internet browser type and
   version, electronic device manufacturer and model, language, time of
   the visit, pages visited, and the name and version of the AIG Digital
   Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to
   ensure that the AIG Digital Services function properly.

   Through your use of an App

   When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may
   track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on
   your electronic device accesses our servers and what information and
   files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

   Physical location

   Subject to applicable law (and your consent where required by
   applicable law), we may collect the physical location of your
   electronic device by, for example, using satellite, mobile/cell phone
   tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to
   provide you with personalised location-based services and content.

   Subject to your marketing preferences and applicable law, we may also
   share your device’s physical location, combined with information about
   what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with
   our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more
   personalised content and to study the effectiveness of advertising
   campaigns.

   In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses
   and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny
   such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be
   able to provide you with the applicable personalised services and
   content.

   In addition, we may obtain the precise geolocation of your device when
   you use our mobile applications for travel or other assistance
   services.  In connection with providing travel or other assistance
   services, we may share your device’s precise geolocation information
   with our clients and other entities with whom we work.  You may opt-out
   of our collection and sharing of precise geolocation information by
   deleting the mobile application from your device, by disallowing the
   mobile application to access location services through the permission
   system used by your device’s operating system, or by following any
   additional opt-out instructions provided in the privacy notice
   available within the mobile application.

   In some circumstances, physical location information may become your
   Personal Information if you are identifiable in relation to the
   physical location information. In such cases, the physical location
   information will be handled as Personal Information as described in the
   earlier sections of this Privacy Policy.

   Using information provided by you

   Some information (for example, your location or preferred means of
   communication) is collected when you voluntarily provide it. Unless
   combined with Personal Information, this information does not
   personally identify you.

   By aggregating information

   We may group information together so that it does not link to a
   specific individual, i.e. aggregate, and use that information (for
   example, we may aggregate information to calculate the percentage of
   our users who have a particular telephone area code).

   Please note that, where user and device data is not Personal
   Information, we may use and disclose that data for any purpose to the
   extent we are allowed to by law. If we are required to treat user and
   device data as Personal Information under applicable law, or if we
   combine user and device data with identifiable Personal Information,
   then, in addition to the uses listed in this section, we may use and
   disclose user and device data for all the purposes for which we use and
   disclose Personal Information.

Services?

   Please refer to our Cookie Policy.

(BUTTON) Who is responsible for third party services accessed via AIG Digital
Services?

   This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for,
   the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties,
   including any third party operating any site or service to which AIG
   Digital Services link.  The inclusion of a link on AIG Digital Services
   does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by
   our group companies.

   Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and
   disclosure policies and practices (including the information security
   practices) of other organizations or any other app developer, app
   provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider,
   wireless service provider or electronic device manufacturer, including
   any Personal Information you disclose to other organisations through or
   in connection with AIG Digital Services.

(BUTTON) When was this Privacy Policy last updated?

   This Privacy Policy was last updated on 31 January 2024.

   We review this Privacy Policy regularly and reserve the right to make
   changes at any time to take account of changes in our business
   activities, legal requirements, and the manner in which we process
   Personal Information.  We will place updates on this website and where
   appropriate we will give reasonable notice of any changes. In certain
   countries, where we process your Personal Information on the basis of
   your consent, we will seek further consent where there are material
   changes to the Privacy Policy as required by law.
