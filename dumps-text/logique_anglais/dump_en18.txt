society



     \'There is\', a former British prime minister once famously claimed,
   \'no such thing as society.\' This remarkable assertion had at least
   two ideological goals. One was the refusal to accept anything other
   than the nature and behaviour of individuals as explanations for human
   action; another was the displacement of socially constructed forms of
   social reproduction through distinctive and formative sets of social
   relations as a significant influence upon the trajectory of human
   society. The intersection of individuals, tainted only by their
   internal nature, through markets was seen as the dynamic of a liberal
   and free society: the world is all agents and one structure â€” the
   market formed in the liberal view simply through the free interaction
   of those agents.
   And yet human being is impossible outside some form of society (e.g.
   Lee, 1989) â€” even non-human society. Society is both an identifiable
   cluster of socially constructed individuals, institutions,
   relationships, forms of conduct, material and social practices and
   discourses that are reproduced and reconstituted across time and space,
   and the condition under which such phenomena are formed. The stress
   here upon relationships, institutions and conduct underlines the point
   that societies are far more than the individuals which comprise them
   but it does not imply that they are unitary or determinant totalities.
   For one thing, the social relations which give direction and evaluative
   norms to practices of social reproduction are difficult, if not
   impossible, to resist â€” at least in the short term and over all but
   the most restricted geographical spaces â€” and, for another,
   Foucauldian notions of regimes of truth (McDowell, 1995) refer to the
   temporary and partial geographies of stabilization of discursive
   formations, the nature of which are definable only in terms of their
   own power/ knowledge.
   At least four levels of meaning may be ascribed to society: (a) human
   (or nonhuman) society in general; (b) historically distinct types of
   society, e.g. feudal society (see feudalism), capitalist society (see
   capitalism), defined in terms of a particular set of social relations;
   (c) particular instances of society, e.g. national societies â€”
   sometimes thought of as national social formations â€” Arabian society,
   Christian society; and (d) particular interest groups (e.g.
   geographical societies) which represent and proselytize the
   significance of discourses related closely to the narrow confines of
   their specific interest. The formative relationships between (a) and
   (c) are problematic and highly complex and involve intersections
   between these different instances.
   Human life is necessarily social in organization, if only for the most
   basic reason that it could not be reproduced outside society (Lee,
   1989). Equally, human life is necessarily part of nature, and nature
   and society are conjoined in the labour process (Gregory, 1978). But
   material production is rarely merely instinctive. It cannot somehow
   predate systems of meaning or significance. Systems of meaning direct
   and endow significance upon material practice. Even in the most
   desperate circumstances of material deprivation, human beings respond
   emotionally as well as physiologically to their plight and try to make
   sense of or protest at the nonsense of their predicament. Social being
   certainly determines consciousness but whether material production
   determines social being is another matter altogether (see economic
   geography). Similarly, the question of \'social being\' itself is
   problematic in that it may presuppose nothing more than adherence to a
   particular discourse or regime of truth.
   Society is always in a process of becoming as a result of the conscious
   actions of human beings â€” including their representations of their
   own circumstances. Indeed, the term social formation carries with it
   the notion that society is an ever-changing process. Human actions are
   informed by society itself, by the understandings held of society â€”
   which may be no more than acceptance of particular discourses â€”
   although these are social practices which presuppose, therefore, some
   prior social, if only competing, discourses, and by the relationships
   between society and its knowledgeable participants. This means that the
   study of society cannot be reduced to the simplicities of natural or
   physical science. We cannot divorce subject and object and alternative
   societies are always possible if we choose to construct them.
   Human beings create societies at the same time as they are created by
   them, and they are knowledgeable participants in this double process of
   creation (see structuration theory). Indeed, Godelier (1986, p. 1)
   argues (italics in original) that
   human beings, in contrast to other social animals, do not just live in
   society, they produce society in order to live. In the course of their
   existence, they invent new ways of thinking and acting â€” both upon
   themselves and upon the nature which surrounds them. They therefore
   produce culture and create history â€¦and he should have added that the
   production of culture and history is predicated upon the making of
   geographies as an essential condition of human existence.
   An alternative view (Mann, 1986, p. 14) of the relationship between
   people and society is that whilst human beings \'need to enter into
   social power relations, â€¦ they do not need social totalities\'. Here
   the very notion of society as \'a bounded and patterned social
   totality\' is questioned whilst, at the same time, the inherent
   sociability of human beings is acknowledged in the recognition of the
   inherency of social relations (Lee, 1989). Michael Mann (1986, p. 5)
   describes the relationship between people and society thus:
   Human goals require both intervention in nature â€” a material life in
   the widest sense â€” and social cooperation. It is difficult to imagine
   any of our pursuits or satisfactions occurring without these. Thus the
   characteristics of nature and the characteristics of social relations
   become relevant to, and may indeed structure, motivations. They have
   emergent properties of their own.Resnick and Wolff (1987) also shy away
   from the idea of a patterned social totality in their rejection of
   determinist and essentialist forms of analysis (cf. essentialism). They
   stress instead the multiple determinations involved in the complex of
   interactions between natural, economic, political and cultural
   processes, each of which may be subdivided into what they call class
   (production, appropriation and distribution of surplus production) and
   the wide (almost limitless) range of non-class processes (e.g.
   commodity exchange, friendship, social intercourse).
   However, it would be a profound mistake to conclude from such arguments
   that human beings are not influenced in a quite fundamental fashion by
   the societies into which they are born and in which they live. Norms
   and values, direction and purpose are social constructs and the social
   relations which articulate such constructs and enable individuals to
   engage with them are inescapable for human involvement in society even
   if they become nothing other than the object of opposition. But again
   such norms and values and so on, are socially constructed not merely
   through social and material practice but through discursive practice
   which endows the social and the material with meaning and purpose.
   The systems of meanings to which people refer help to define the
   society to which they, in practice, belong. In one sense, societies are
   the means and the consequence of communication between human subjects.
   The breakdown of communication signals the breakdown of society in time
   and space and so offers one means of defining particular societies.
   However, it follows that no pure form of society can exist and that no
   clear social boundaries based upon a particular set of criteria may,
   realistically, be drawn (see time-space distanciation).
   Even societies defined in terms of production relations never exist in
   a pure state. They are always mixed with other forms of social
   relations (see social formation). And even within, say, capitalist
   societies there is great scope for cultural, political, moral and
   ideological differentiation. The struggle for hegemony â€” for
   sustainable regimes of truth which in turn reside in practice and in
   the social relations through which people attempt to make sense of
   their lives (Lee, 1989) â€” is, therefore, a fundamental driving force
   in human society. An alternative interpretation which assumes social
   determination and closure and treats society as a system with clearly
   defined boundaries is associated with the writings of Talcott Parsons
   (see functionalism).
   Distinctions may be drawn between economy, state and society. The
   intention of so doing is to try to separate the idea of an association
   of free individuals from the coercion of economic imperatives or state
   power. John Urry (1981), for example, refers to \'civil society\' and
   defines it as \'that set of social practices outside the relations and
   forces of production in which agents are both constituted as subjects
   and which presuppose the actions of such subjects\' in struggling to
   sustain their conditions of existence. This is a helpful concept
   because it recognizes the interdependence but extreme variability of
   social practices which both make up and transform society (Bauman,
   1991).
   Society remains a contested concept. Some fear the implication that to
   admit to society means to accept a form of social determinism, the
   denial of individual responsibility in the making of geography and
   history or, in opposition to such a view, the failure to recognize that
   \'an individual subject is constructed through a grid of discourse and
   practice\' (McDowell, 1995, p. 288) which, nevertheless and by
   definition, accepts the existence of the social even if it is only ever
   constructed instantly and fleetingly. Others object to the possibility
   that society implies a form of totalizing discourse taking place,
   somehow, behind the backs of knowing subjects. As an example, Peter
   Jackson (1989, p. 18) notes that Carl Sauer adopted a super-organic
   approach to culture which asserts that \'culture is an entity at a
   higher level than the individual, that it is governed by a logic of its
   own and that it actively constrains human behaviour\' (see Berkeley
   School). Such an approach \'severely limits the questions that may be
   asked\' as the answer is offered before the question is posed.
   Questions of the formation of identity and social practice through
   discourse become irrelevant. But notions of super-organicism do force
   the issue of memory and the path dependency of historical geographies
   â€” socially constructed as they always are.
   Paradoxically, neo-classical economics, that most asocial of social
   theory, makes massive assumptions about the sociability of people.
   Communication is assumed to be perfect, instantaneous and unproblematic
   in the market economy. If ever there was a totalizing discourse which
   limits questioning, it is this doctrine so beloved of liberal champions
   of individual freedom.Â (RL)
