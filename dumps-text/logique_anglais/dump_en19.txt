   It is widely assumed that admission to elite U.S. universities is based
   solely on academic merit—the best and brightest are admitted to
   Harvard, Yale, and their peer institutions as determined by test scores
   and GPA, and not by lineage or family income. But does reality support
   those expectations? Or are admissions governed by a logic that rewards
   socioeconomic status while disguising it as personal merit?

   The Power of Privilege examines the nexus between social class and
   admissions at America's top colleges from the vantage point of Yale
   University, a key actor in the history of higher education. It is a
   documented history of the institutional gatekeepers, confident of the
   validity of socially biased measures of merit, seeking to select
   tomorrow's leadership class from among their economically privileged
   clientele. Acceptance in prestigious colleges still remains beyond the
   reach of most students except those from high-income professional
   families. Ultimately, the author suggests reforms that would move
   America's top schools toward becoming genuine academic meritocracies.
   "This close examination of admissions, always carefully contextualized
   in the broad historical trends in elite higher education of which they
   were a part (just a few of the connections that the book fruitfully
   explores are anti-Semitism, forays into eugenics, the rise of
   standardized tests, and the quantification of character), draws our
   focus to the hidden mechanisms by which reproduction is effected. This
   is important work and will likely be the book's most lasting
   contribution... This well-written and often fascinating book exhorts
   readers to look vigilantly behind the rhetoric of meritocracy and to
   pay closer attention to the real effects of admissions
   policies."—American Journal of Sociology
   "[An] excellent 'sociological account' of a highly selective
   institutional gatekeeper: Yale University... Soares's history of Yale
   admissions is tragically amusing. He chronicles an embarrassing past
   that includes Yale's enthusiasm for the early SAT as a tool of eugenics
   and the college's participation, until 1968, in the Ivy League practice
   of taking nude pictures of freshmen men to study the relationship
   between body type and ability."—Chronicle of Higher Education
   "Soares presents compelling evidence that the Scholastic Assessment
   Test (SAT, later renamed the Scholastic Achievement Test) not only
   opened ivy-covered doors to a more academically talented and diverse
   student body but also assured the continued selection of students from
   the highest economic stratum... He provides an interesting social
   history of admissions at one institution and a window into a world
   that, if Soares is correct, most readers likely were never intended or
   permitted to set foot."—Review of Higher Education
   "'Even Americans unfamiliar with the word embrace meritocracy as if it
   were a birthright,' writes Soares, who taught sociology at Yale and
   uses the university as a test case for a stinging indictment of how far
   Yale and similar colleges fall short of the meritocratic ideal. He also
   offers provocative suggestions for reform."— Yale Alumni Magazine
   "Soares has become something of an expert on the social transformations
   of universities. His first book, also from Stanford, was The Decline of
   Privilege: The Modernization of Oxford University, which traced the way
   Oxford evolved from its Brideshead Revisited image to an institution
   that had meritocratic values. In an interview, Soares said he wanted to
   do an American companion and started off assuming he would find the
   same sort of evolution in the United States. But with a focus at Yale,
   that's not what he found. Given that Yale has described itself
   repeatedly as having gone through such an evolution, this was
   surprising to Soares, and he argues that the differences between myth
   and reality point to important steps for a number of colleges to
   consider today."—Inside Higher Ed
   "The Power of Privilege is a provocative critique of theories of
   meritocracy in admission decisions at elite American universities.
   Distinguishing between factors that influence who applies to elite
   schools and those that increase the odds of admission, Soares draws
   nuanced inferences about class reproduction. This is must reading for
   anyone interested in understanding admission policies and practices in
   elite universities."—Francisco Ramirez, Stanford University
   "The Power of Privilege clarifies the dynamics of elite reproduction,
   shows how privilege and social inequality are deeply embedded in
   institutions, and demonstrates the important role that meritocratic
   schools plays in society. This book is masterful. Joseph Soares has
   established himself as one of the most promising social critics."
   —Judith Blau, author of Justice in the United States, Professor of
   Sociology, University of North Carolina
   "The Power of Privilege is a welcome addition to the literature on
   elite colleges, educational stratification, and the meritocratic myth
   in college admissions. This is a story not just of SAT scores, but also
   of admissions processes that favor legacies, athletes, and nebulous
   qualities of leadership and character in which the interests of the
   wealthy and professional classes in securing advantages for their
   children indeed are well served! Fundamental change may be unlikely
   anytime soon, but Soares nevertheless advances some interesting
   proposals for opening the gates a bit wider." —Karl Alexander, Johns
   Hopkins University
   "[The Power of Privilege] shows to anyone without experience in college
   admissions the ambiguity of constructing admissions policies and
   converting how someone is presented 'on paper' into a judgment of that
   individual's potential for future success. One of the book's strengths
   is Soares' engaging writing style, which captures the complexity of the
   issue but is nonetheless highly readable. This broadens its appeal
   beyond experts in the field to an audience perhaps less familiar with
   the scholarly body of work pertaining to questions of meritocracy and
   social reproduction.... The Power of Privilege provides an engaging
   counterargument to claims by Lemann (1999) and others that pure
   academic merit prevails over socioeconomic privilege in current college
   admissions."—Teachers College Record
