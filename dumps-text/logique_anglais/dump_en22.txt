       Reconsidered.», Vol. 92 (2011) 321-346
       This study continues a line of inquiry from the author’s previous
       essay regarding the 12^th century BCE battle traditions embedded in
       the Song of Deborah (Judg 5) as the basis for a nascent Exodus
       ideology surfacing in the Song of the Sea (Exod 15). Exod 15 is
       identified as developing an agrarian ideal into a basis for
       national identity: Israel’s successful struggles against competing
       Canaanite military forces echoing earlier Egyptian imperial
       hegemony is liturgized into a myth where YHWH defeats the Egyptian
       foe and then settles his own sacred agrarian estate.

   Biblica_1:Layout 1 21-11-2011 12:59 Pagina 329 329 EISODUS AS EXODUS:
   THE SONG OF THE SEA tion of Deut 32 must have occurred at a time when
   these linguistic changes were already entrenched in the poem. If we
   accept a similar oral/cultic background to Exod 15, then the fact that
   its textual form shows no later linguistic features â€” a completely
   unique feature in the canon of biblical Hebrew poetry â€” can best be
   explained by the fact that it was committed to text at an early point
   in time, i.e., before later linguistic conventions could bleed into the
   normative form of the poem through prolonged recitation. There can be
   little doubt that Exod 15 continued to be recited orally down to the
   8th and 7th centuries; the fact that a later scribe in- corporated it
   into the Exodus narrative indicates that it continued to be well known
   in the scribeâ€™s time and that its inclusion would im- mediately
   command the attention of the scribeâ€™s intended audience 33. However,
   the linguistic features ossified in the canonical form of the poem
   reveal that an antique version of this work was utilized by this
   scribe. The scribe in question must have drawn from an archival tex-
   tual source rather than a contemporaneous oral rendition, the latter of
   which would have invariably included later linguistic forms from the
   scribeâ€™s own day 34. By contrast, the poemâ€™s early textualization
   33 This phenomenon is common to the incorporation of older poetry into
   narrative contexts elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. J.W. WATTS, â€œSong
   and the Ancient Readerâ€, Perspectives in Religious Studies 22 (1995)
   146, puts the mat- ter well when he remarks: â€œthe inclusion of poetry
   within narrative expanded the latterâ€™s representational scope and,
   especially, its affective impact on hearers and readersâ€. The
   literary logic governing the inclusion of poetry into prose narrative
   changes over time, however. See S. WEITZMAN, Song and Story in Biblical
   Narrative. The history of a literary convention in Ancient Israel
   (Bloomington, IN 1997) for a full discussion. 34 On the matter of a
   textual archive available to the later â€“ probably priestly â€“ scribe
   who shaped the Exodus account, see VAN DER TOORN, Scribal Culture,
   63-65, 69-70, 86-89. Van der Toorn notes the centrality of temple
   archives and temple-based scribal â€œworkshopsâ€ where sacred texts
   were preserved and trans- mitted over long periods of time in a variety
   of ancient loci, and there is no rea- son to suppose that this was not
   also the case in Jerusalem. This would especially be the case during
   the late pre-exilic period given the deep impact of both Egyptian and
   Mesopotamian political culture on the state institutions of Judah by
   that time. Carr, Tablet of the Heart, 168, is skeptical that texts
   produced by temple scribes in the late pre-exilic period would have
   been taken with the exiles to Babylon. However, if written works had
   obtained a ritual-iconic status as argued recently by J.W. WATTS,
   Ritual and Rhetoric in Leviticus. From Sac- rifice to Scripture (New
   York â€“ Cambridge 2007) 193-214, then it is reasonable to assume that
   some important written works were brought to Babylon by the
