   THE LOGIC OF ECONOMICS

   Economic life is an enormously complicated hive of activity, with
   people buying, selling, bargaining, in- vesting, persuading, and
   threatening. The ultimate purpose of economic science and of this text
   is to understand this complex undertaking. How do economists go about
   their task?
   Economists use the scientific approach to understand economic life.
   This involves observing economic affairs and drawing upon statistics
   and the historical record. For complex phenomena like the impacts of
   gelled deficits or the causes of inflation,
   historical research has provided a rich mine of insights.

   Often, economics relies upon analyses and theories. Theoretical
   approaches allow economists to make broad generalizations, such as
   those. concerning the advantages of international trade
   and specialization or the disadvantages of tariffs and quotas.

   In addition, economists have developed a specialized technique known as
   econometric, which applies the tools of statistics to economic
   problems. Using econometric, economists can sift through mountains of
   data to extract simple relationships.Budding economists must also be
   alert to common fallacies in economic reasoning. Because
   economic relationships are often complex, involving many different
   variables, it is easy to become confused about .the exact reason behind
   events or the impact of policies on the economy. The following are some
   of the common fallacies encountered in economic reasoning:

   • The post hoc fallacy. The first fallacy involves the inference of
   causality. The post hoc fallacy occur.s when tilt assume that, because
   on/’ event occurred before another event, the fir.st event Taurus the
   second event.2 An example of this syndrome occurred in the Great
   Depression of the 1930’s in the United States. Some people had observed
   that periods of business expansion were preceded or accompanied by
   rising prices. From this, they concluded that the appropriate remedy
   for depression was to raise wages and prices. This idea led to a host
   of legislation and regulations to prop lip wages and prices in an
   inefficient manner. Did these measures promote economic recovery?
   Almost surely not. Indeed, they probably slowed recovery, which did not
   occur until total spending

   “Post hoc” is shorthand for post hoc. prop'” hoc. Translated from the
   Latin, the full expression means “after this. therefore
   necessarily because of this.”

   began to rise as the government increased military spending ill
   preparation for World War II.• Failure 10 hold other Hings constant, A
   second pitfall is failure to hold other things constant when thinking
   about an issue. For example. we might want to know whether raising tax
   rates will raise or lower tax revenues. Some people have put forth the
   seductive argument that we can eat our fiscal cake and have it too.
   They argue that cutting tax rates will at the same time raise
   government revenues and lower the budget deficit. They point to the
   Kennedy:Johnson tax cuts of 1964, which lowered tax rates sharply and
   were followed by an increase in government revenues in 1965, Hence,
   they argue, lower tax rates produce

   higher revenues. ‘

   What is wrong with this reasoning? This argument overlooks the fact
   that the economy grew from 1964 to 1965. Because people’s incomes grew
   during that period, government revenues also, grew, even though tax
   rates were lower, Careful studies indicate that revenues would have
   been even higher, in 1965 had tax rates not been lowered in 1964. hence
   , this analysis fails to hold other things (namely, total income )
   constant.

   Remember to hold other things constant when you are analyzing the
   impact of (variable on the economic system.

   • The fallacy of composition. Sometimes, we assume that what holds true
   for part of a system also holds true for the whole. In economics,
   however,we often find that the whole is different from the sum of the
   parts.when you  assume that what is true for the part is also true for
   whole , you are  for the whole committing the fallacy’)’ of
   composition.

   Here are some true statements that might surprise surprise  you if
   you ignored the fallacy of composition: (I) If one farmer has a bumper
   crop. she has a higher income; if all farmers produce it record crop,
   farm incomes will fall. (2) If one person receives a great d(‘;11 more
   money, that person will be better off; if everyone receives a great
   deal more money,. the society is likely 10 be worse off. (3) If a high
   tartaric is put on the product of a particular industry, the producers
   in I hat industry are likely to profit: if hi~h tariffs an’ put on all
   industries, most producers and consumers will be worse off.

   I’these examples contain no tricks or magic.Rather, they are the
   results of systems of interacting individuals. Often the behavior of
   the aggregate looks very different from the behavior of’ individual
   people.

   We mention these fallacies only briefly in this introduction. Later, as
   we introduce the tools of economics,we will provide examples of how
   inattention to the logic of economics can lead you to false
   and sometimes costly errors. When you reach the end of this book, you
   can look back to see why each of these paradoxical examples is true.
