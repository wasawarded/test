   Titanic in China: Transnational
   Capitalism as Official Ideology?

   In April 1998, Titanic garnered the accolade of becoming China’s
   all-time blockbuster by shattering former box-office records. The
   “Titanic miracle,” as the film’s unprecedented commercial success was
   dubbed in the Chinese media, provides copious material with which to
   explore numerous issues at stake in China’s contemporary culture
   industry, including questions concerning the globalization and
   commercialization of the culture industry within the context of China’s
   domestic market reforms and official Party ideology. How is China
   participating in and recreating global culture? How are China’s
   expanding market reforms affecting the production and consumption of
   culture? What is the role of the Party’s official ideology in relation
   to the commercialization and globalization of culture? How are
   alliances being constructed along the axis of capital across national
   borders?

   Exploration of these questions is based on research conducted in China
   centered on investigating the commercial practices and discursive
   rhetoric which propelled and shaped the “Titanic miracle.” It appears
   that the film industry in China is predominately governed by a
   commercial logic dictated by profit maximization, as adopted by both
   official cultural policies and commercial practices. As played out by
   the “Titanic miracle,” we observe how culture remains an ideological
   tool for the Party whose central maxim appears to be commercial
   enterprise and economic growth. Whereas cultural artifacts during the
   Maoist era, as dictated by the Party, ideologically opposed capitalism,
   today’s culture industry embraces the market and “what sells in
   accordance with official cultural policy.” In the case of the film
   industry, Hollywood films are eagerly adopted to fulfill the commercial
   and official objective of making money. In the end, as the “Titanic
   miracle” illustrates, China’s film industry is marked by an unexpected
   collusion between Hollywood movie-moguls and high-ranking Leninist
   officials, whose ideological differences and national loyalties are
   negotiated by their homage to the accumulation of capital.
