Java Basics: What Is WebLogic?

   Java Application Development
   Enterprise Development

   With its extensive suite of enterprise functionalities, WebLogic is a
   popular choice for Java development. But how does WebLogic compare to
   other platforms and application servers?

   In this blog, we give an overview of WebLogic, including how popular
   WebLogic is in 2024, use cases for WebLogic, and comparisons to other
   application servers such as Tomcat and JBoss / Wildfly.

What Is WebLogic?

     Oracle WebLogic Server is a scalable, enterprise Java platform
     application server for Java-based web applications. The WebLogic
     Server mediates the exchange of requests from the client tier with
     responses from the back-end tier.

   WebLogic allows users to develop and deploy an application that has
   business logic and allows the application to access other services like
   database, messaging, or other enterprise systems. It is a robust
   platform for distributed applications.

   Originally, WebLogic wasn‚Äôt always in the Oracle portfolio. In fact, it
   joined the Oracle product portfolio in 2008 when BEA Systems, a
   software company that developed it, was acquired by Oracle. WebLogic
   Server offers a robust, highly available, and secure environment for
   critical applications.

What Is WebLogic Used For?

   WebLogic is a platform where you deploy your Java application and
   everything else is handled by the server. When clients make a request
   to a web application the web server will handle the request and
   delegate its processing to the required service. If the request
   requires reading data for example from the database, WebLogic will take
   care of it. The client doesn't know what happened in the background and
   is served with the required content.

   In fact, the server is usually used in the production environments,
   where there are many clients making thousands of requests every time
   and the server must be able to serve all of them without any issues. To
   achieve stability and high availability, usually, load balancing and
   scalability is used within the application server. The application can
   be deployed to the server in several ways. Below is the example of
   deploying the application using the Administration Console.

Is WebLogic Popular?

   WebLogic is popular within the commercial sphere ‚Äî where companies
   require reliable software that comes with enterprise support. According
   to the 2024 Java Developer Productivity Report, 36% of respondents said
   they use Tomcat as the application server for their main application,
   with JBoss/Wildfly (15%), WebLogic (12%), WebSphere (10%), Jetty (10%),
   and Glassfish/Payara (8%) taking near even shares of the remainder.

   Another 7% respondents said they don‚Äôt use an application server, and
   nearly a quarter of respondents selecting more than one application
   server option. If you only consider servers that implement Jakarta EE
   Full Profile specification, WebLogic is dominating the market.

     stacks? Find out in the 2024 Java Developer Productivity Report.

WebSphere vs. WebLogic

     WebSphere Application Server (WAS) is a web application server that
     is used as a middleware to host Java-based web applications.

   Developed by IBM, WAS is written in Java so it can be run on any
   operating system where Java is supported. While writing this article,
   Version 9.x of WAS supports Java EE7 Full Profile. You may also hear
   the word ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù with a connection to WAS. WebSphere Liberty is a
   lightweight application server with low overhead that is designed for
   cloud applications and microservices.

   If you are a single developer, both editions are free for development
   purposes. In an environment where more than one person is using the
   server, the purchase of a commercial license is required.

WebLogic vs. Tomcat

   While Apache Tomcat is the most popular application server, it offers a
   limited set of features from the Jakarta EE Full Profile specification,
   such as Java Servlet or JavaServer Pages. For some enterprise
   applications, however, that limited feature set might not be enough.

   Offering limited features makes Tomcat a lightweight server with quick
   redeploys. But because it's lightweight, it suffers in usability. If
   the application requires more Java EE features, WebLogic is often the
   better choice.

   üê± Learn more about Apache Tomcat: read the blog.

   With WebLogic, users get access to the commercial support from Oracle.
   Apache Tomcat doesn‚Äôt have dedicated support, but you can get support
   for Tomcat from OpenLogic by Perforce.

   OpenLogic provides support for:
     * Tomcat security, including preventing issues like the Ghostcat
       vulnerability.
     * Tomcat clustering, including Tomcat 7 and Tomcat 8.
     * And so much more.

Get Support For Tomcat

     Whether you're considering a migration from WebLogic to Tomcat ‚Äî or
     you're already using Tomcat and want support ‚Äî OpenLogic experts can
     help. Get in touch today to learn how.

WebLogic vs. JBoss / Wildfly

   Two application servers that play a big role in an enterprise sphere
   are WebLogic and JBoss / WildFly. Both offer full support for Java EE
   8. One of the key differences is that JBoss / Wildfly is open source
   and free while WebLogic is paid product with commercial support. Red
   Hat also offers commercial support for a fee.

Final Thoughts

   If you are considering a tool for a production environment with a heavy
   load and you also need most or all from the Java EE specification,
   WebLogic is a good candidate. While there are other servers that have
   similar functionality, one of the advantages of WebLogic is its
   excellent integration with other products from Oracle.

   WebLogic Server is a commercial product that requires buying a license,
   but you will get access to enterprise support as well. Due to all its
   features, WebLogic isn‚Äôt really a lightweight solution, so make sure
   you compare the servers well before choosing for one ‚Äî including
   redeploy times.

   Fortunately, there's a solution to long redeploy times. With JRebel,
   you can eliminate redeploys in any application server and IDE while
   maintaining application state. These time savings are more than just
   spare minutes; they add up to real business value.
