  The new W3C standard RDF (Resource Description Framework) describes a metadata
  infrastructure which can accommodate classification elements from different
  vocabularies i.e. schemas. The underlying model consists of a labeled directed
  acyclic graph which can be linearized into eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
  transfer syntax for interchange between applications.This paper will demonstrate
  how a new system, Metalog, allows users to write metadata, inference rules
  and queries in English-like syntax. We will demonstrate how these reasoning
  rules have equivalent representation both as RDF descriptions and as logic
  formulae. We will also show how an automated compilation between these
  translations is possible, showing the effectiveness of the system, which
  aims to be a first step towards the ambitious project of Tim Berners-Lee's
  semantic web.
</DIV>
<H2>
  The Metalog Approach
</H2>
<P>
RDF provides the basis for structuring the data present in the web in a
consistent and accurate way. However, RDF is only the first step towards
the construction of what Tim Berners-Lee calls the <I>semantic web</I>, a
World Wide Web where data is structured, <I>and</I> users can fully benefit
by this structure when accessing information on the web. RDF only provides
the "basic vocabulary" in which data can be expressed and structured. Then,
the whole problem of <I>accessing</I> an <I>managing</I> these data structured
arises.
<P>
Metalog provides a "logical" view of metadata present on the web. The Metalog
approach is composed by two major layers.
<P>
The first layer consists in an enrichment of the RDF model. Metalog provides
way to express logical relationships like "and", "or" and so on, and to build
up complex <I>inference rules</I> that encode logical reasoning. This "semantic
layer" builds on top of RDF using a so-called <I>RDF schema</I>. We call
this level of Metalog the <I>Metalog model</I> level.
<P>
The second layer consists of a "logical interpretation" of RDF data (optionally
enriched with the semantic schema) into logic. This way, the understood semantics
of RDF is unwound into its logical components. This means that every reasonment
on RDF data can be performed acting upon the corresponding logical view,
providing a neat and powerful way to reason about data. We call this level
of Metalog the <I>Metalog logic</I> level.
<P>
The third layer is a language interface to writing structured data and reasoning
rules. In principle, the first component already suffices: data and rules
can be written directly in RDF, using RDF syntax and the metalog schema.
However, this is not convenient from the practical viewpoint. Indeed, RDF
syntax aims at being more an encoding language rather than a user-friendly
language, and it is well recognised in the RDF community and among vendors
that the typical applications will provide more user-friendly interfaces
between the "raw RDF" code and the user. Our proposed language is innovative
in that it tries to stress user-friendliness as much as possible: a program
is a collection of <I>natural language</I> assertions. We think this feature
will be particularly important for the wide deployment not only of metalog,
but of RDF itself: the measure of the success of metadata and proper structuring
of information on the web is given by the number of people that will actually
lose time and energy in write (and/or translate) data into the structured
format. Therefore, it is of primary importance that the entry level is kept
extremely easy, to avoid that the difficulty of just learning how to encode
and structure data will just block the widespread diffusion of metadata in
the web. Also, this level incorporates in a natural way the concept of
<I>query</I> to interact with the structured data and the inference rule.
We call this level of Metalog the <I>Metalog language</I> level.
<P>
Another important feature of the language, in this respect, is indeed that
it can be used just as an interface to RDF, without the metalog extensions.
This way, users will be able to access and structure metadata using RDF in
a smooth and seamless way, using the metalog language.
<P>
Therefore, the typical interaction of the user with the Metalog system will
be: in the "building" process of setting up the data and the logical inferences,
the user will be able to simply express these using the Metalog language.
This layer is translated into the Metalog model, and then using the Metalog
logic interpretation, into logic. From here, classic inference engines can
then be applied, like logic programming, datalog, theorem provers and so
on. Also, all the already existing RDF data will enter this "chain" directly
into the Metalog model level.
<H2>
  The Metalog Model
</H2>
<P>
We can extend RDF so that the mapping to logic is able to take advantage
of all of the logical relationships present in logical systems: that is to
say, behind the ability of expressing <I>static facts</I>, we want the ability
to encode <I>dynamic reasoning rules,</I> like in logic programming.
<P>
In order to do so, we need at least:
<UL>
  <LI>
    the connectors: <I>and</I>, <I>or</I>, <I>implies</I>
  <LI>
    variables
</UL>
<P>
The metalog schema extends plain RDF with this "logical layer", enabling
to express arbitrary logical relationships within RDF. In fact, the metalog
schema provides more accessories besides the aforementioned basic ones (like
for example, the "<I>not</I>" connector, and support for <I>math</I> operators):
anyway, for the sake of clarity, we don't go into further details on this
topic: the basic building blocks are the connectors <I>and</I>, <I>or</I>,
<I>implies</I>, and the variables. What the reader should keep in mind is
therefore just that the Metalog model provides the "meta-logic" operators
to reason with RDF statements.
<P>
Technically, this is quite easy to do: the metalog schema is just a schema
as defined by the RDF schema specification where, for example, <I>and</I>
and <I>or</I> are subinstances of the RDF <I>Bag</I> connector.
<H2>
  The Metalog Logic
</H2>
<P>
Once we have extended "syntactically" the RDF model with connectors, the
next step is to provide a <I>semantical</I> interpretation of these, in
conjunction with a semantical interpretation of the RDF model (that is to
say, a semantical interpretation of the "Metalog model" as a whole).
<P>
The first correspondence in Metalog is between the basic RDF data model and
the predicates in logic. The RDF data model consists of so-called
<I>statements</I> Statements are triples where there is a subject (the
"resource"), a predicate (the "property"), and an object (the "literal").
Metalog views an RDF statement in the logical setting as just a binary predicate
involving the subject and the literal. For example, the RDF statement expressing
the fact that <I>Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web </I>(formally, the RDF
triple <I>{invented, Tim Berners-Lee, Web}</I>) is seen in logic as the predicate
<I>invented(Tim Berners-Lee, Web)</I>. So, in general RDF statements have
a natural translation into logic predicates. The exceptions that Metalog
does are for the so-called <I>sequencing</I> constructs in RDF: Bag, Seq
and Alt. These are codified using specific varyadic functors (named, indeed,
Bag, Seq and Alt...), with in addition in the Bag case equations to make
the Bag operator act like a set-like operator (that is to say,
Bag(X_1,...,X_n)=Bag(X_p(1),...,X_p(n)) for every permutation p). So, in
fact, Metalog logic is a kind of equational logic (see also later, in the
case of the mathematical operators).
<P>
The second natural correspondence is the interpretation of the specific Metalog
extension: the connectors <I>and</I>, <I>or</I> and <I>implies</I> are
interpreted as the logical conjunction, disjunction and implication,
respectively. Variables are interpreted as logical variables. En passant,
we mention the other extensions provided by Metalog, the <I>not</I> connector
and the mathematical extensions. Metalog provides support for integer arithmetic,
with the functions <I>add</I>, <I>sub</I>, <I>times</I>, <I>divide</I>, and
the predicates <I>less</I>, <I>greater</I>, <I>less_or_equal</I>,
<I>greater_or_equal</I>, that have the expected equational interpretation.
As far as the <I>not</I> connector is concerned, things are less easy: while
for the other interpretation the logical interpretation is rather straightforward
(in other words, in the almost totality of the useful logics, these operators
have all the same interpretation), a logical interpretation of the not connector
is not as plain: there are different alternatives to consider, giving different
logics. The Metalog choice follows from the intrinsic nature of the World
Wide Web (where the Metalog system is expected to be used), as a distributed
knowledge basis, with possibly partial information available: we chose the
interpretation of the <I>not</I> connector to be <I>negation as failure
(NAF)</I>, that is to say, we opted for the Closed World Assumption (CWA).
Another point to consider is that since the interpretation of the <I>not</I>
is in any case such a delicate parameter, the interpretation of the not as
NAF has been kept as flexible as possible, using namespaces, as we will see
next.
<P>
Summing up, the mapping between the Metalog model and logical formulas is
then completely natural: for each RDF statement that does not use a metalog
connector, there is a corresponding logical predicate as defined before.
Then, the metalog connectors are translated into the corresponding logical
connectors as described above.
<H3>
  Namespaces
</H3>
<P>
Metalog employs different namespaces for its extensions, in order to allows
easy extensibility, modification and reuse of its components. Therefore,
there are <I>three</I> different namespaces in action: the first namespace
(<TT>http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog</TT>) is for the connectors <I>and</I>,
<I>or</I>, <I>implies</I>, and for the variables (that is to say, the "core"
set of Metalog). Then, the <I>not</I> connector has a different namespace
(namely <TT>http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/not/NAF</TT>), thus allowing other
different not's to be used if needed. Finally, all the mathematical extensions
have yet another namespaces (<TT>http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/Math</TT>),
to allow easy upgrade/extensions of the mathematical facilities in the future.
<H2>
  The Metalog Syntax
</H2>
<P>
The third layer is then the actual syntax interface between the user and
the Metalog model layer.
<P>
The metalog syntax has been explicitly designed with the purpose of being
totally natural-language based, trying to avoid any possible technicalities,
and therefore making the language extremely readable and self-descriptive.
<P>
The way metalog reaches this scope is by a careful use of upper/lower case,
quotes, and by allowing a rather liberal positioning of the keywords (an
advanced parser then disambiguates the keywords from each metalog program
line).
<P>
Upper/lower case is used to distinguish between normal keywords and variables:
variables are expressed using names all in upper case (for example,
<TT>FOO</TT> is a variable). Words that are in lower case either are
<I>keywords</I> (reserved words), or if not, they are ignored. For example,
<TT>then</TT> is a keyword, while <TT>foo</TT> is not, and so it is just
ignored (it is only syntactic sugaring). Other words can be either keywords,
or they are just ignored. In the current version of metalog, words cannot
intermingle upper and lower case: this helps to reduce errors and to improve
readability, since it strengthens the layout difference between variables
and the other words.
<P>
Finally, any name which is between double quotes (for example,
<TT>"John"</TT>) is a datum (a fixed constant).
<H3>
  Keywords
</H3>
<P>
The following set of keywords are reserved in metalog. Interpretation of
the keywords is done in metalog on a positional basis: the position of the
keyword with respect to other keywords and/or other data determines the
interpretation of the sentence. The reserved keywords are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <TT>then</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)<BR>
    For example,<BR>
    <TT>if SHE has a "degree" in "math" then SHE "is" "smart"</TT><BR>
    is translated into the logical formula<BR>
    <I>degree(SHE,"math") =&gt; is(SHE,"smart")</I><BR>
    (Note that, here and in the following examples, we provide directly the
    translation into the logical formula, to save space; a more detailed translation
    would have to also show the intermediate RDF model, which is in any case
    trivial to derive).
  <LI>
    <TT>imply</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)
  <LI>
    <TT>implies</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)
  <LI>
    <TT>and</TT> can be either the metalog <I>and</I> (the "logical-and"), or
    it can be used to indicate the presence of an RDF Bag (the "bag-and"): this
    is disambiguated by the context<BR>
    For example, <TT><BR>
    if SHE has a "degree" in "math" and SHE has a "degree" in "computer science"
    as well then SHE "is" "really smart"</TT>.<BR>
    is translated into the logical formula<BR>
    (<I>degree(SHE,"math") and degree(SHE,"computer science"))=&gt; is(SHE,"really
    smart")</I><BR>
    On the other hand, as said, and can be used to denote an RDF Bag (a set):<BR>
    <TT>the "technical report 231" has as "authors" "Mary" and "John"</TT>.<BR>
    is translated into the logical formula:<BR>
    <TT><I>authors("technical report 231",Bag("Mary","John"))</I></TT>
  <LI>
    <TT>or</TT> can be either the metalog <I>or</I>, or it can be used to indicate
    the presence of an RDF Alt (an alternatives list) : this is disambiguated
    by the context
  <LI>
    <TT>order</TT> the presence of this keyword turns an RDF Bag into an RDF
    Seq (an ordered list).<BR>
    For example,<BR>
    <TT>the "technical report 231" has as "authors" "Mary" and "John"</TT> <TT>in
    this order</TT>.<BR>
    is translated into the logical formula:<BR>
    <TT><I>authors("technical report 231",Seq("Mary","John"))</I></TT>
  <LI>
    <TT>not</TT> can be combined with other metalog constructs.<BR>
    For example<BR>
    <TT>if SHE has a "degree" in "math" then SHE "is" not "stupid"</TT>.<BR>
    is translated into the logical formula<BR>
    <I>degree(SHE,"math") =&gt; not(is(SHE,"stupid"))</I>
</UL>
<P>
The dot is the separator between metalog program lines. For formatting purposes,
carriage returns, line feeds can tabs can be used: they are simply ignored.
Commas, semicolons and question marks are reserved keywords: we'll explain
commas in the next section, and question marks in the "Queries" section.
On the other hand, semicolons are reserved for future use.
<P>
<I>Note</I>: metalog programs also have a number of other keywords to deal
with, to name some, namespaces (via the keyword <TT>namespace</TT>), mathematical
operators, versioning. We will not go in further details since we won't be
explicitly using namespaces sugaring here, but en passant we just mention
that essentially the <TT>namespace</TT> keyword has the same functionality
as the <TT>xmlns</TT> attribute for XML namespaces. And, as said, there are
a number of other keywords that deal with numbers operations (e.g.,
<TT>greater</TT>, <TT>less</TT>, etc.), but for the sake of brevity we don't
go in their (rather obvious) description.
<H3>
  Parsing
</H3>
<P>
Parsing is positional. Let's introduce some terminology here. Call "quotation"
everything that in a metalog language chunk is among quotes; keyword and
variable have just the usual metalog meaning. Call a "holder" either a variable
or a quotation. So for example, in
<P>
<TT>SHE has a "degree" in "math" then SHE "is" "smart"</TT>
<P>
the quotations are <TT>"degree"</TT>, <TT>"math"</TT>, <TT>"is"</TT> and
<TT>"smart"</TT>, the variables are <TT>SHE</TT>, all of these are holders;
the keywords are: <TT>then</TT>. Interpretation then occurs as follows.
<P>
First, a so-called <I>strip-off </I>phase occurs, where all the "junk" (parts
that are neither quotations nor variables nor keywords) are eliminated. Note
that it is not strictly necessary for the parser to do a strip-off in advance,
and indeed in our current implementation the strip-off occurs incrementally,
as the sentences are processed, in a much more efficient way. But, for the
sake of explanation, it's clearer to assume this strip-off part is executed
in advance. So, in the above example, after strip-off we obtain <TT>SHE "degree"
"math" then SHE "is" "smart".</TT>
<P>
Then, we disambiguate using the metalog keywords. The basic metalog mapping
structure (here, we use a mapping directly to logic rather than to Metalog
model for conciseness) follows the classic grammatical model of basic sentence,
where we have a <I>subject</I> followed by a <I>predicate</I> and then an
<I>object</I>. This triple "<I>subject predicate object</I>" is naturally
translated into the logic binary
predicate&nbsp;<I>predicate(subject,object)</I>. On top of this "basic model"
of translation, more sophisticated constructs are added, using the metalog
keywords.
<P>
Metalog has several interoperating rules that deal with keyword processing
and ambiguities. In the following, we describe the core parsing algorithm,
to give an idea of the kind of algorithmic involved.
<P>
Let's refer to level 1, 2 or 3 if we are at a position where we expect to
have a "subject", "predicate" or "object". For example, if we are parsing
the above example from left to right, and we are at the point <TT>if SHE
has a "degree"</TT>, then we've just parsed a level 2 ("degree") and expect
a level 3. Parsing occurs left-to-right, according to the above general pattern,
only that when a keywords is found, various things can happen: if we find
a "<TT>then</TT>", "<TT>imply</TT>" or "<TT>implies</TT>" keyword, it means
we translate all what was to the left (say, obtaining <I>#LEFT#</I>), all
what is to the right (say, obtaining <I>#RIGHT#</I>), and logically translate
to "<I>#LEFT# =&gt; #RIGHT#</I>" (here, <I>=&gt;</I> denotes logical
implication). Note that a "<TT>then</TT>" can generally occur only when a
level 1 is expected (although,&nbsp;the above definition is more general).
<P>
If we find an "<TT>and</TT>": if the "<TT>and</TT>" occurs when a level 1
is expected, then it could be a logical-and or the bag-and; if there's a
holder soon after the object to the right of the and, then it's a logical-and;
otherwise, it's a bag-and, and the level still stays 3. If the "<TT>and</TT>"
occurs when a level 2 is expected, then it's a bag-and: it means that the
holder soon before the <TT>and</TT>, and the next to come, are concatenated
into an RDF Bag construct (Bag than can be turned into an RDF Seq if the
"<TT>order</TT>" keyword is found).
<P>
Logical-and translation: we have the logical translation "<I>#LEFT# and
#RIGHT#</I>". For example, take the metalog sentence
<P>
<TT>if SHE and HE have a "degree" in "math" and "science" and "John" "is"
"good" then .... </TT>
<P>
Doing the strip off, we obtain: <TT></TT>
<P>
<TT>SHE and HE "degree" "math" and "science" and "John" "is" "good" then
.... </TT>
<P>
Now we start the parsing from left to right (in the following, the denote
with Bag(a,b,c,...) the bag composed by elements a, b, c, ...):
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>SHE</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 1</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>and</TT></TD>
    <TD>where a level 2 was expected, so...</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>HE</TT></TD>
    <TD>... Bag(SHE,HE) is the new level 1</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"degree"</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 2</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"math"</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 3</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>and</TT></TD>
    <TD>where level 1 was expected: after "science" there is a keyword, so it's
      a bag-and, which means...</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"science"</TT></TD>
    <TD>... Bag("math","science") is level 3</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>and</TT></TD>
    <TD>where level 1 was expected: after "John" there is a holder
      ("<TT>good</TT>"), so it's a logical-and</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"John"</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 1</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"is"</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 2</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>"good"</TT></TD>
    <TD>level 3</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>then</TT></TD>
    <TD>all of the above (<I>#LEFT#</I>), implies all of the following
      (<I>#RIGHT#</I>)</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>...</TT></TD>
    <TD>...</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
So, the final logical translation is
<P>
<TT><I>degree(Bag(SHE,HE),Bag("math","science")) and is("John","good") =&gt;
.... </I></TT>
<P>
Another important component in the metalog language syntax is represented
by <I>punctuation</I>. Punctuation plays a relevant role to define the structure
of metalog: for example, <I>dots</I> ("<TT>.</TT>") &nbsp;are used to separate
metalog sentences, and <I>question marks</I> ("<TT>?</TT>") to denote queries.
Besides these, <I>commas</I> are used to act as delimiter, a helpful construct
in case ambiguities arise. For example, consider the following example, obtained
slightly modifying the above example:
<P>
<TT>if SHE and HE have a "degree" in "math" and "science" and "John" and
"Mary" "are" "good" then .... </TT>
<P>
This sentence is given the supposedly wrong interpretation by Metalog that
<P>
<I>degree(Bag(SHE,HE),Bag("math","science","John")) and are("Mary","good")
=&gt; .... </I>
<P>
while to express the fact that both John and Mary are good we can use the
comma punctuation: the above example becomes
<P>
<TT>if SHE and HE have a "degree" in "math" and "science", and "John" and
"Mary" "are" "good" then ....</TT>
<P>
or equivalently
<P>
<TT>if SHE and HE have a "degree" in "math" and "science", and "John" and
"Mary" "are" "good", then ....</TT>
<P>
The formal rule to deal with commas in the parsing process is that a comma
forces a level 1.
<H2>
  Queries
</H2>
<P>
In general, query languages are formal languages to retrieve data from a
database. Standardized languages already exist to retrieve information from
different types of databases such as Structured Query Language (SQL) for
relational databases and Object Query Language (OQL) for object databases.
<P>
Semi-structured query languages such as XML-QL [3] operate on the document
level structure.
<P>
With RDF, the most suitable approach is to focus on the underlying data model.
Even though XML-QL could be used to query RDF descriptions in their XML encoded
form, a single RDF data model could not be correctly determined with a single
XML-QL query due to the fact that RDF allows several XML syntax encodings
for the same data model. And, XML-QL and other similar XML query languages
(see QL'98 [7]) have the big limitation to query syntactically, and not
semantically.
<P>
Instead, the fact the ultimate point of the "Metalog chain" is the Metalog
logic, leads itself to a natural definition of query: (constructive)
satisfability. That is to say, any given logical formula can be queried along
the database, to check whether it is satisfable or not (and, in the positive
case, the appropriate variable bindings are to be returned). We provide a
construct in the Metalog language to express such a query: the <I>question
mark</I> every metalog language sentence ending with a question mark is supposed
to be a query, and as such it should not be added to the knowledge base,
but its satisfability can be possibly checked by an appropriate inference
engine.
<H2>
  Computability
</H2>
<P>
Note that the RDF metalog model and the corresponding translation into logical
formulas in the Metalog logic is absolutely general. However, in practice,
one need also to then be able to process the resulting logical formulas in
an effective ways. In other words, while the Metalog model nicely extends
RDF with the full power of first order predicate calculus (and more), thus
increasing by far the <I>expressibility</I> of basic RDF, there is still
the other, <I>computational</I>, side of the coin: how to process and effectively
reason with all these logical inference rules.
<P>
Metalog as such does not impose computability restriction, as its primary
goal is to provide expressibility means to codify logical data and relationships
(and relative queries). Then, it is up to the particular inference engine
to try to effectively deal with the resulting logical knowledge basis. However,
there are at least two restrictions of the logic that deserves particular
attention: <I>logic programming </I>and <I>datalog</I> (see e.g. [1]). These
paradigms are that they are computationally rather efficient, such that there
are many implementations available that implement these languages; moreover,
in the case of datalog, querying is also always terminating: that is to say,
no matter what query we give, a datalog program (if correctly implemented)
will always return the answer(s) in a <I>finite</I> amount of time. The
interesting things that makes these languages particularly appealing in our
case is due to the fact that both logic programming and datalog restrict
to binary predicates: this means that RDF (without the ordering structures)
is already directly mappable, via Metalog, into a logic program. Therefore,
just relatively small syntactical constraints enables a metalog language
program (and so, logic formula) to be ultimately processed in an effective
way using an already existing &nbsp;logic programming or datalog inference
engine. This is indeed what we are currently doing with our current prototype:
interfacing with existing logic programming/datalog systems (like, for example
, [8]).
<P>
The way Metalog deals with such syntactic restrictions is twofold. The first
is liberal: it is up to the implementation to check whether the metalog language
code does actually satisfy the corresponding restrictions such to be interpreted
as a logic program, or as a datalog program. This is consistent with the
general philosophy of Metalog as being a <I>purely declarative </I>and
<I>highly expressive</I> language. The second way is to actually annotate
the metalog language code with a <I>restriction tag</I>: a restriction tag
is a metalog sentence expressing the fact that the code indeed satisfies
the appropriate syntactic restrictions. So far, there are two restriction
tags, one for logic programming and the other for datalog. It is important
to note that these restriction tags are just <I>annotations</I>, that is
to say they are in all equivalent to comments, but for the fact that they
provide a hint to an eventual application that tries to process the metalog
code, that some particular inference engine (for logic programs, datalog
programs, etc) could be profitably used. It is <I>semantically transparent</I>,
since there is no actual representation of a restriction tag in the metalog
model layer.

  A more detailed example

<P>
Suppose we want to encode the rule that if a person is the author of a document
in some language (for example, English), then he can speak in that language.
The corresponding metalog program would be:
<P>
<TT>if the "language" of a DOCUMENT is Y <BR>
and the "author" of the DOCUMENT is X <BR>
then X can "speak" Y.</TT>
<P>
This can be translated into the following piece of XML/RDF syntax:
<P>
<TT>&lt;implies&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;and&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicate
name="language"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf: seq&gt; <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;DOCUMENT&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;Y&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicate
name="author"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf: seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;DOCUMENT&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;X&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&lt;/rdf:seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/and&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicate name="speak"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf: seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;X&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;Y&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&lt;/implies&gt;</TT>
<P>
And, finally, this corresponds to the logical formula
<P>
<I>speak(X,Y) &lt;= (author(DOCUMENT,X) and language(DOCUMENT,Y))</I>
<P>
This formula is just a Horn clause, and as such it means it can be viewed
as a logic program.
<P>
So, suppose we have already grabbed from somewhere in the Web some pieces
of RDF that tell us, for example, that "John" is the author of "technical
report 231", and that the language of "technical report 231" is "English".
This, again, can be viewed as part of a logic program (technically, they
are <I>facts</I>).<BR>
Then, if we want to know what language does John speak, we can just ask
<P>
<TT>what "language" does "John" "speak"?</TT>
<P>
which is translated into the corresponding query
<P>
<I>speak("John",Y).</I>
<P>
Running this query in the corresponding logic program gives the result that
<I>Y="English"</I>, that is to say, the predicate
<I>speak("John","English")</I> is true.<BR>
Hence, the corresponding metalog sentence, returned as answer, is:
<P>
<TT>"John" "speaks" "English"</TT>

The more ambitious project that we are tackling right now using Metalog is
the complete management of the W3C web site. W3C is a complex organization,
and its web site is the big white board on which information is shared and
processed. Thousands of people every day look for related information, and
produce new information on the W3C site. All this information is stored like
the state of the art allows: part is stored in separate databases files,
and the vast majority just resides in static web pages. Therefore, to access
and manipulate the information, one has to either go and perform a manual
search, or resort on primitive tools like the local Altavista-based search
engine. The "next-generation" W3C site, instead, will hopefully be based
on the Metalog infrastructure. As much as possible of the data will b
