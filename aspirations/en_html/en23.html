  <b>By Andrea Yew</b><br></p>
  
  <p class="bodytext">
          <p>    <em>An Equal Joy: Reflections on  God, Death and Belonging</em><br>    Catherine  Lim<br>    Marshall  Cavendish (2017) / 212 pages / SGD24.30    </p><p>    Catherine  Lim's latest collection, <em>An  Equal Joy: Reflections on God, Death and Belonging</em>, is a <em>memento mori</em> of sorts, a collection of essays written in  response to Lim's realisation of her own mortality. Across a series of twenty-two  essays, Lim explores questions of religion, death and science. In her  collection, Lim sets out to answer her own questions that she has accumulated  through life. As such, this collection charts a personal journey for Lim  through the medium of narrative.     </p><p>    From  the outset, Lim opens up her collection with an unabashed admission of the solipsistic  nature of this collection. As she states:    </p><blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p>    It is thus a completely  self-absorbed book, written to myself, for myself, about myself. Narcissism of  the most unabashed kind! But since my readers have indulged me for so long,  they may not mind one more display of the idiosyncrasy that has governed much  of my writing.    </p></blockquote><p>    On  one hand, the admission that it is a "self-absorbed book" can be off-putting as  it rings of indulgence and suggests that the book is premised on Lim's existing  popularity as an award-winning writer for its readership. As Lim herself states:  "It consists of short chapters in no particular order of chronology or  significance, with no overall connecting theme or tone." Indeed, the collection  jumps between essays about science, early humans, and speculations on the  private life of religious figures with seemingly no connection whatsoever. While  it may chart Lim's personal treasure trove of knowledge, the jumps are jarring,  making the collection seem like a random mishmash of thought. As such, at  times, the collection can seem like the indulgent, solipsistic presentation of  Lim's personal headspace. Even within each essay, the meandering prose makes it  difficult to follow Lim's train of thought at times and, hence, the argument  she puts forth, if any, is unclear. For instance, in 'Guilt', Lim begins her  essay by describing the gods of her childhood, "the Taoist Tee Kong" and "the  Christian God of her adult years". The essay describes the guilt she felt as a  child for seemingly having caused misfortune to befall others through her own  perceived blessings she has received in life. However, the essay mysteriously  brings in Galileo at the end, the only connection of Galileo with her childhood  guilt encapsulated in the sentence: "I wonder whether, in the case of Galileo,  it was guilt or fear that finally left him a broken man." The link between  Galileo and Lim is puzzling and thus comes across as quite a leap. Furthermore,  the essay concludes with an even more puzzling link to Adam and Eve, as she  remarks: "The story about our first parents Adam and Eve should have had a  happy ending…the apple of knowledge should not have been forbidden in the first  place, but readily available to all who sought it." The original portrayal of  guilt is long lost at this point.   Although each essay, like this, is characteristically bookended by Lim's  conclusion, the essay seems to be governed by an internal logic that eludes the  reader.     </p><p>    Nevertheless,  the collection is arguably Lim's final answer to the fear of death, which is  the collection's central preoccupation. As the collection concludes with the  final essay, 'An Equal Joy', the collection's namesake: "I have loved and lived  life richly and deeply, and I embrace its closure with an equal joy." On one  hand, it foregrounds the notion that the collection is very much a presentation  of Lim's answers to the questions she has accumulated through life, the closing  statement to a rich life. However, it is striking as the line is also intended  to be Lim's own obituary. Art, represented through this collection, will always  stand the test of time, and is Lim's response to the transience of life. As  such, the collection is also a meditation on the relationship between art and  mortality.    </p><p>    <em>An Equal Joy</em> is very much a personal  narrative space for Lim. As she states in her introductory essay: "This book is  about the long and intense spiritual journey I have undertaken, with its many  conflicts of head and heart, logic and feeling, joy and pain, certitude and  doubt". True to her introduction, the collection is a working through of  conflict as Lim answers the questions she presents herself. The collection is a  space for catharsis, which is reflected in both its content and structure. Lim  titles her essays with a mix of questions and personal conclusions. For  instance, there are essays questioning 'Did the Neanderthals Have Souls?' to  doctrinal essays such as 'My Holy/ Holistic Trinity' or 'The Right To Die'.     </p><p>    In  Lim's collection, narratives are presented as a means of working through conflict.  For instance, in 'A Bondmaid named Hoon', Lim responds to her own questions  about her original work, <em>The  Bondmaid</em>, in which a reader had asked "Why did you have to make  Han die in the end? Why couldn't she have had a happy life after all that  terrible suffering?" In response, Lim wrote 'A Bondmaid Named Hoon', an  alternative parallel to <em>The  Bondmaid</em>, in which Hoon exacts the justice her original  protagonist did not. However, she had her own misgivings even after the story  was finished.  As Lim states: "And I  certainly was not at all comfortable about Hoon. Why? I didn't know then, and  I'm not sure I know now." Lim goes on to summarise the story of Hoon. However,  what is significant is that through the retelling of the narrative, Lim also  resolves some of her personal misgivings. As she states even before she summarises  her story: "A summary of the abandoned story of the bondmaid Hoon may explain  the reason for the abandonment of a novel that I had begun with such gusto."  The choice of 'may explain' suggests that the author herself does not know what  answers she might find, and hence points to a working through of conflict. And  it is by the end of the essay that we see Lim's coming to terms with her own  questions, finding the answer to her own question. As she states: "My  discomfort with this character was, I think, due to a strong discomfort with  myself for having created her" and, subsequently: "I had no choice but to admit  to something that was worse than a mistake — malice, small-mindedness and a pettiness unworthy of  the serious business of writing". The shift in language from 'I think' to 'I  had no choice but to admit' reflects Lim's working through of her own questions  through narratives on multiple levels. At the first level, narrative is used as  an emotional response to a question. We see this similarly reflected in Lim's  speculations on the private life of Jesus as well, most aptly seen in 'Did  Jesus Have A Sense of Humor?'. However, on another level, it is also through  the medium of narrative or, rather, reflecting upon an alternative narrative  that Lim also works through her own personal conflicts, moving from particular  questions to more general answers about her views on writing. In this sense,  the collection's structure can also be interpreted similarly. Lim's essays,  whilst on one hand a direct emotional response to questions, also reflect a  summation of her life philosophies, a compilation of her experiences and a synthesis  of a lifetime of accumulated knowledge.     </p><p>    However,  while Lim's collection may have provided personal catharsis, it can isolate the  reader at times, given that her answers are very specific to a set of questions  she has defined, dictated by her idiosyncratic interests, such as her interest  in the private lives of public or religious figures. For instance, the essay 'A  Tale of Princess Diana' presents an alternate narrative predicated upon the  idea of cloning princess Diana, and its social and legal implications. As Lim  states:    </p><blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p>    This story was written on a  whim, has never been published and never will be. Hence I allowed myself to end  it with any number of questions, some of them quite nonsensical, most of them  unanswerable, because ultimately when the science clashes with social, ethical,  psychological, philosophical and legal matters.    </p></blockquote><p>    However,  given that the story is published as part of the collection, this sets up the  reader's expectation that some conclusion is to be derived from it. This is not  to say that all narratives must end on a conclusive note but, rather, there  must be a point to the narrative that extends beyond the 'whim' of the writer, as  to do otherwise seems rather arrogant and presumptuous. The merit of this  collection should not depend on Lim's fame alone rather than its contribution  to a body of literature.  While the  collection provides answers for Lim, as a work of art, it needs to go beyond  the writer to resonate with the reader. Concluding a narrative spawned from a  peculiar interest in the private life of Princess Diana with even more  unanswered questions is frustrating at best for the reader. Even Lim's  fascination with Princess Diana is puzzling. Perhaps something within Princess  Diana's glamorous life resonated with Lim's colourful one, as she admits to  being 'intrigued by the paradoxes in the princess's life'. Perhaps Lim's  alternative narrative surrounding the implications of cloning is an exploration  of the possibility and implications of immortality. This becomes an especially  pertinent question, especially if Lim found parallels between her literary  renown and Princess Diana's fame and, hence, Princess Diana's death is viewed  as a timely reminder of Lim's own mortality. However, the reader can only  speculate. The link between Lim, Princess Diana and cloning is tentative at  best and frustrating at worst.  Perhaps  it is in the nature of the objective of this collection that comes across as a  swansong of Lim's life experiences, consisting of both questions answered and  unanswered. However, as a literary work, it leaves the reader expecting more.     </p><p>    All  in all, Lim's collection brings to mind Plato's wise words: "An unexamined life  is not worth living." In the face of her own mortality, Lim's collection brings  together a lifetime of experience and knowledge to present her own personal  life philosophy, providing a sense of closure for a life well-lived. However, it  is very much a collection written for herself. </p>
