<P>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model&amp;Syntax
Specification describes a metadata infrastructure which can
accommodate classification elements from different vocabularies
i.e. schemas. The underlying model consists of a labeled directed
acyclic graph which can be linearized into eXtensible Markup
Language (XML) transfer syntax for interchange between applications.

<P>This paper will demonstrate how a new querying language, Metalog,
allows users to write inference rules and queries in English-like
syntax. We will demonstrate how these reasoning rules have equivalent
representation both as RDF descriptions and as logic programs. We will
also show how an automated compilation between these translations is
possible.

<P>For the sake of clarity, here we will just give an overview of the
system, trying to avoid technicalities and cumbersome details.
</DIV>

<H2>Query Languages</H2>

<P>In general, query languages are formal languages to retrieve data
from a database. Standardadized languages already exist to retrieve
information from different types of databases such as Structured Query
Language (SQL) for relational databases and Object Query Language
(OQL) and SQL3 for object relational databases.

<P>Semi-structured query languages such as 
XML-QL [3] operate on a document level structure taking
advantage of the internal element structure of an XML document.

<P>Logic programs consist of facts and rules where valid inference
rules are used to arrives into new facts i.e. query results.

<P>With RDF, the most suitable approach is to focus on the underlying
data model. Even though XML-QL could be used to query RDF
descriptions in their XML encoded form, a single RDF data model could
not be correctly determined with a single XML-QL query due to the fact
that RDF allows several XML syntax encodings for the same data model.

<H2>The Metalog Approach</H2>

<P>RDF provides the basis for structuring the data present on the Web
in a consistent and accurate way. However, RDF is only the first step
towards the construction of what Tim Berners-Lee calls the "Web of
knowledge", a World Wide Web where data is structured, <I>and</I>
users can fully benefit by this structure when accessing information
on the Web. RDF only provides the "basic vocabulary" in which data can
be expressed and structured. Then, the whole problem of
<I>accessing</I> an <I>managing</I> these data structures arises.

<P>Metalog provides a "logical" view of metadata present on the
Web. The Metalog approach is composed of several components.

<P>In the first component, a particular data semantics is
established. Metalog provides way to express logical relationships
such as "and", "or" and to build up complex <I>inference
rules</I> that encode logical reasoning.  This "semantic layer" builds
on top of RDF using a so-called <I>RDF schema</I>.

<P>The second component consists of a "logical interpretation" of RDF
data (optionally enriched with the semantic schema) into logic
programming. This way, the understood semantics of RDF is unwielded
into its logical components (a logic program, indeed). This means that
every reasonment on RDF data can be performed acting upon the
corresponding logical view, the logic program, providing a neat and
powerful way to reason about data.

<P>The third component is a language interface to writing structured
data and reasoning rules. In principle, the first component already
suffices: data and rules can be written directly in RDF, using RDF
syntax and the Metalog schema. However, this is not convenient from
the practical viewpoint. Indeed, RDF syntax aims at being more an
encoding language rather than a user-friendly language, and it is well
recognised in the RDF community and among vendors that the typical
applications will provide more user-friendly interfaces between the
"raw RDF" code and the user. Our proposed language is innovative in
that it tries to stress user-friendliness as much as possible: a
program is a collection of <I>natural language</I> assertions. We
think this feature will be particularly important for the wide
deployment not only of metalog, but of RDF itself: the measure of the
success of metadata and proper structuring of information on the Web
is given by the number of people that will actually lose time and
energy in write (and/or translate) data into the structured
format. Therefore, it is of primary importance that the entry level is
kept extremely easy, to avoid that the difficuly of just learning how
to encode and structure data will just block the widespread diffusion
of metadata on the Web.

<P>Another important feature of the language, in this respect, is
indeed that it can be used just as an interface to RDF, without the
metalog extensions. This way, users will be able to access and
structure metadata using RDF in a smooth and seamless way, using the
metalog language.

<H2>The Metalog Schema</H2>

<P>The first correspondance in Metalog is between the basic RDF data
model and the predicates in logic. The RDF data model consists of
so-called <I>statements</I>. Statements are triples where there is a
subject (the "resource"), a predicate (the "property"), and an object
(the "literal"). Metalog views an RDF statement in the logical
setting as just a binary predicate involving the subject and the
literal. For example, the RDF statement expressing the fact that
<I>Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web </I>(formally, the RDF triple
<I>{invented, Tim Berners-Lee, Web}</I>) is seen in logic programming
as the predicate <I>invented(Tim Berners-Lee, Web)</I>.

<P>Once we have estalished the basic correspondance between the basic
RDF data model and predicates in logic, the next step becomes easy: we
can extend RDF so that the mapping to logic is able to take advantage
of all of the logical relationships present in logical systems: that
is to say, beyond the ability of expressing <I>static facts</I>, we
want the ability to encode <I>dynamic reasoning rules,</I> like in
logic programming.

<P>In order to do so, we need at least:

<UL>
  <LI>the standard logical connectors (<I>and</I>, <I>or</I>, <I>not</I>)
  <LI>variables
</UL>

<P>The Metalog schema extends plain RDF with this "logical layer",
enabling the expression of arbitrary logical relationships within
RDF. In fact, the Metalog schema provides more accessories besides the
aforementioned basic ones. Without elaborating here all the Metalog
schema elements since they will be presented later, what the reader
should keep in mind is just that the Metalog schema provides the
"meta-logic" operators to reason with RDF statements.

<P>Technically, this is quite easy to do: the metalog schema is just a
schema as defined by the RDF schema specification [Brickley99] where,
for example, <I>and</I> and <I>or</I> are sub-instances of the RDF
<I>Bag</I> connector.

<P>The mapping between "metalog RDF" and logical formulas is then
completely natural: for each RDF statement that does not use a Metalog
connector, there is a corresponding logical predicate as defined
before. Then, the metalog connectors are translated into the
corresponding logical connectors in the natural way (so, for instance,
the metalog <I>and</I> connector is mapped using logical conjunction,
while the metalog <I>or</I> connector is mapped using logical
disjunction).

<H2>The Metalog Syntax</H2>

<P>Note that the RDF metalog schema and the corresponding translation
into logical formulas is absolutely general. However, in practicse,
one need also to then be able to process the resulting logical
formulas in an effective ways. In other words, while the RDF metalog
schema nicely extends RDF with the full power of first order predicate
calculus, thus increasing by far the <I>expressibility</I> of basic
RDF, there is still the other, <I>computational</I>, side of the coin:
how to process and effectively reason with all these logical inference
rules.

<P>It is well known that in general dealing with full first order
predicate calculus is totally unfeasable computationally. So, what we
would like to have is a subset of predicate calculus that is still
expressible enough, and also computationally feasible: our choice went
to <I>logic programming</I>.  Logic programming (see e.g. [1]) is a
well known programming paradigm that selects a subset of full
first-order predicate calculus (so called Horn clauses); it is a very
powerful and expressive paradigm, and has the further advantage that
it has been widely studied in the database community (a subset of
logic programming, <EM>datalog</EM>, has even the advantage of having
computations always terminating, a feature of obvious interest for Web
queries).

<P>The third level is then the actual syntax interface between the
user and this "metalog RDF" encoding, with the constraint that the
expressibility of the language must fit within the one provided by
logic programming.

<P>The metalog syntax has been explicitly designed with the purpose of
being totally natural-language based, trying to avoid any possible
technicalities, and therefore making the language extrememly readable
and self-descriptive.

<P>The way metalog reaches this scope is by a careful use of
upper/lower case, quotes, and by allowing a rather liberal positioning
of the keywords (an advanced parser then disambiguates the keywords
from each metalog program line).

<H3>Metalog grammar</H3>

<P>The tokens in the Metalog language can be rougly divided into 
four categories:

<OL>
<LI>variables
<LI>literals
<LI>keywords
<li>noise words
</OL>

<p>In the following subsections we present how these tokens are
recognized. There is also an example following each of these
subsections to demonstrate how the recognization works in practice.

<H4>Variables</H4>

<P>Upper/lower case is used to distingush between normal keywords and
variables: variables are expressed using names all in upper case (for
example, <TT>FOO</TT> is a variable). Words that are in lower case
either are keywords (reserved words), or if not, they are ignored. For
example, <TT>then</TT> is a keyword, while <TT>foo</TT> is not, and so
it is just ignored (it is only syntactic sugaring). Other words can be
either keywords, or they are just ignored. In the current version of
metalog, words cannot intermingle upper and lower case: this helps to
reduce errors and to improve readability, since it strengthens the
layout difference between variables and the other words.

<pre class="example">
SHE X Y CAR RDF
</pre>

<H4>Literals</H4>

<P>Any name which is between double quotes (for example,
"John") is a literal (datum, a fixed constant).

<pre class="example">
"en" "http://www.w3.org/" "Massimo" "a=b+2"
</pre>

<H4>Keywords</H4>

<P>The following set of keywords are reserved in metalog.
Interpretation of the keywords is done in metalog on a positional
basis: the position of the keyword with respect to other keywords
and/or other data determines the interpretation of the sentence. The
reserved keywords are:

<UL>
  <LI>
    <TT>then</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)<BR>
    For example,<BR>
    <TT>if SHE has a "degree" in "math" then SHE "is" "smart"</TT><BR>
    is translated into the logical formula<BR>
    <I>degree(SHE,"math") =&gt; is(SHE,"smart")</I><BR>

    (Note that, here and in the following examples, we provide
    directly the translation into the logical formula, to save space;
    a more detailed translation would have to also show the
    intermediate RDF model, which is in any case trivial to derive).

  <LI><TT>imply</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)
  <LI><TT>implies</TT> is a keyword for the logical implication (=&gt;)

  <LI><TT>and</TT> can be either the metalog <I>and</I>, or it can be
  used to indicate the presence of an RDF Bag: this is disambiguated
  by the context<BR> For example, <TT><BR> if SHE has a "degree" in
  "math" and SHE has a "degree" in "computer science" as well then SHE
  "is" "really smart"</TT>.<BR> is translated into the logical
  formula<BR> (<I>degree(SHE,"math") and degree(SHE,"computer
  science"))=&gt; is(SHE,"really smart")</I><BR> On the other hand, as
  said, and can be used to denote an RDF Bag (a set):<BR>

    <TT>the "technical report 231" has as "authors" "Mary" and
    "John"</TT>.<BR> is translated into the logical formulas (the
    translation here is more involved since the RDF Bag construct is
    used):<BR> <TT>authors("technical report 231",foo).<BR>
    rdf:type(0,rdf:Bag).<BR> rdf:_1(0,"Mary").<BR>
    rdf:_2(0,"John").</TT>

  <LI><TT>or</TT> can be either the metalog <I>or</I>, or it can be
  used to indicate the presence of an RDF Alt (an alternatives list) :
  this is disambiguated by the context

  <LI>
    <TT>order</TT> the presence of this keyword turns an RDF Bag into
    an RDF Seq (an ordered list).<BR> For example,<BR> <TT>the
    "technical report 231" has as "authors" "Mary" and "John"</TT>
    <TT>in this order</TT>.<BR> is translated into the logical
    formulas (the translation here is more involved since the RDF Bag
    construct is used):<BR> <TT>authors("technical report
    231",foo).<BR> rdf:type(foo,rdf:Seq).<BR> rdf:_1(foo,"Mary").<BR>
    rdf:_2(foo,"John").</TT>

  <LI><TT>not</TT> can be combined with any other metalog constructs,
  and its interpretation is logical negation.<BR> For example, <BR>
  <TT>if SHE has a "degree" in "math" then SHE "is" not
  "stupid"</TT>.<BR>
  is translated into the logical formula<BR>
  <I>degree(SHE,"math") =&gt; not(is(SHE,"stupid"))</I>
</UL>

<P>The dot is the separator between metalog program lines. For
formatting purposes, carriage returns, line feeds can tabs can be
used: they are simply ignored.  Similarly, commas and semicolon can be
used as well.

<P>A trailing question mark is used to denote a query.

<P><I>Note</I>: metalog programs also have a facility to express
namespaces via the keyword <TT>namespace</TT>. We will not go in
further details since we won't be explicitly using namespaces sugaring
here, but en passant we just mention that essentially the
<TT>namespace</TT> keyword has the same functionality as the
<TT>xmlns</TT> attribute for XML namespaces. Also, there are a number
of other keywords that deal. for example, with numbers operations
(e.g., <TT>greater</TT>, <TT>less</TT>, etc.), but for the sake of
brevity we don't go in their (rather obvious) description.

<pre class="example">
if then and or order not what who of 'is one of'
</pre>

<H4>Noise words</H4>

<p>Any token not recognized by the rules above is discarded
during the parsing process which is the reason why we call
them noise words. The following example presents input
for Metalog with detailed description what tokenization
rule are used.

<pre class="example">
The "language" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/ is "en"
->
Noise(The) Literal(language) Keyword(of)
Literal(http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog)
Keyword(is) Literal(en).
</pre>

<H4>Complete grammar</H4>

<pre class="example">
rule 1    start -> query
rule 2    start -> statements
rule 3    start -> rules
rule 4    statements -> statements statement
rule 5    statements -> statement

rule 7    rules -> rule
rule 8    rule -> IF conditions THEN conditions
rule 9    statement -> LITERAL OF LITERAL IS negation value

rule 25   query -> WHAT IS querybody
rule 26   query -> IS LITERAL OF LITERAL negation value
rule 27   querybody -> LITERAL OF LITERAL
rule 28   querybody -> LITERAL OF VARIABLE
</pre>

<h2>Completeness requirements</h2>

<p>Designing a new query language for RDF data model requires
inherently that the language covers all RDF constructs. These
constructs are 

<ul>
<li>statements
<li>containers: bag, alt, seq
<li>higher-order statements
</ul>

<h2>Conflicts with Natural Language</h2>

<p>The main issue when dealing with a syntax based on natural English
language is how to determine <i>predicate</i>, <i>subject</i>,
and <i>object</i> always correctly? (i.e. the building blocks of
RDF statements)

<pre class="example">
Janne's email is jsaarela@w3.org
vs.
The email of Janne of jsaarela@w3.org</pre>

<pre class="example">Homepage of W3C is at http://www.w3.org/
vs.
W3C homepage is at http://www.w3.org</pre>

<h2>Restrictions on the natural language</h2>

<p>The <b>'s</b> genetive form is available for people only. Nouns
need <b>of</b> genetive structure as well. People can also use
<b>of</b> genetive -> adopt only one structure i.e. <b>of</b>.

<p>If the predicate is a verb and not an adjective
e.g.
<pre class="example">Janne speaks English</pre>
it is not possible to translate this to Metalog!?
"Speaks" of "Janne" is "English"

<h3>Reserved keywords</h3>

<p>Metalog reserves the use of the following keywords in the input
syntax and cannot be used by the author.

<ul>
<li>if
<li>then
<li>and
<li>or
<li>order
<li>not
<li>what/who
<li>of
<li>is one of
</ul>

<hr title="Statements of RDF">
<h2>Roles of Metalog</h2>

<p>Metalog can be used into three different purposes: authoring
and understanding <i>facts</i>, <i>rules</i>, and <i>queries</i>.
We will elaborate their definition and expression in Metalog
in the following subsections.

<h3>Facts in Metalog</h3>

<p>Facts are recognized by the lack of existance of both <b>if</b> and
<b>what</b> keywords withn a Metalog sentence. In this case, the first
token will be a variable or a literal.

<p>Some examples of tokenization of Metalog facts:

<pre class="example">
"language" of "http://www.w3.org/" is "en" ->

literal keyword(of) literal keyword(is) literal</pre>

<pre class="example">
"author" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog" are
"Massimo Marchiori" and "Janne Saarela" ->

literal keyword(of) literal keyword(are)
literal keyword(are) literal</pre>

<h3>Rules in Metalog</h3>

<p>Rules are recognized by the existance of the
<b>if</b> keyword as the first token of a Metalog sentence.

<p>Let us examine an example of tokenization of a rule:

<pre class="example">
If the "language" of RESOURCE is X and
the "author" of RESOURCE if Y then
the "connaissance" of Y is X. ->

keyword(if) literal variable variable keyword(and)
literal keyword(of) variable variable keyword(then)
literal keyword(of) variable variable</pre>

<h3>Queries in Metalog</h3>

<p>Queries are recognized by the existance of the
<b>what</b> keyword as the first token of a Metalog sentence.

<P>Let us examine an example of tokenization of a query:

<pre class="example">
What is the "language" of "http://www.w3.org/"? ->

keyword(what) literal keyword(of) literal</pre>

<hr title="Containers in RDF">
<h2>Containers in RDF</h2>

<p>Metalog supports the container structures of RDF i.e.
<i>bags</i>, <i>alternatives</i>, and <i>sequences</i>.
The following subsections elaborate how these structures
differ from each other and how they are encoded in Metalog.

<h3>Bags</h3>

<p>Bags do not preserve of implicate order. Thus, it is safe to
say multiple values within a statement i.e.

<pre class="example">
The "author" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog" are
"Massimo Marchiori" and "Janne Saarela". ->

literal keyword(of) literal keyword(are)
literal keyword(and) literal</pre>

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<p>Alternatives imply that only one member of a Alternative container
is valid at a time. This sets requirements for authoring and
querying. In authoring, the Metalog statement must imply the values of
the statement are mutually exclusive with the reserved keyword
combination <b>is one of</b>. In querying ..?

<p>Let us examine the tokenization of Metalog sentences using
Alternatives:

<pre class="example">
The "author" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog" is one of
"Massimo Marchiori" and "Janne Saarela". ->

literal keyword(of) literal keyword(is one of)
literal keyword(and) literal</pre>

<h3>Sequences</h3>

<p>Sequences do preserve order in RDF which sets requirements for
authoring and querying. In authoring, the Metalog statement must imply
the values of the statement have order with the <b>order</b> reserved
keyword. In querying, additional constraints can be set to a query
i.e. whether <b>2.</b> or <b>3.</b> value matches or multiple values
match in given order.

<p>Let us examine the tokenization of couple of Sequence related
Metalog senteces:

<pre class="example">
The "author" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog/" are
"Massimo Marchiori" and "Janne Saarela" in this order.->

literal keyword(of) literal keyword(are)
literal keyword(and) literal keyword(order).</pre>

<pre class="example">
Who is the 2. "author" of "http://www.w3.org/RDF/Metalog"? ->

keyword(who) keyword(2.) literal keyword(of) literal</pre>

<H3>A detailed example</H3>

<P>Suppose we want to encode the rule that if a person has written a
document in some language (for example, English), then he can speak in
that language. The corresponding metalog program would be:

<P><TT>if the "language" of a DOCUMENT is Y <BR> and the "author" of
the DOCUMENT is X <BR> then X can "speak" Y.</TT>

<P>This can be translated into the following piece of RDF syntax:

<P>
<TT>&lt;Procedure&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;Head&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Conjunction&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicate name="speak"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;X&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;Y&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Conjunction&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/Head&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;Body&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;Conjunction&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicates&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Predicate
name="creator"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;DOCUMENT&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;X&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Predicate name="language"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;DOCUMENT&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lt;rdf:li&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;Y&lt;/Variable&gt;&lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Predicate&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/rdf:li&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/rdf:Seq&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/Predicates&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/Conjunction&gt;<BR>
&nbsp; &lt;/Body&gt;<BR>
&lt;/Procedure&gt;</TT>
<P>
And, finally, this corresponds to the logical formula
<P>
<I>speak(X,Y) &lt;= (author(DOCUMENT,X) and language(DOCUMENT,Y))</I>
<P>
So, suppose we have already grabbed from somewhere on the Web some pieces
of RDF that tell us, for example, that "John" is the author of "technical
report 231", and that the language of "technical report 231" is
"English".<BR>
Then, if we want to know what language does John speak, we can just ask
<P>
<TT>what "language" does "John" "speak"?</TT>
<P>
which is translated into the corresponding query
<P>
<I>speak("John",Y).</I>
<P>
Running this query in the corresponding logic program gives the result that
<I>Y="English"</I>, that is to say, the predicate
<I>speak("John","English")</I> is true.<BR>
Hence, the corresponding metalog sentence, returned as answer, is:
<P>
<TT>"John" "speaks" "English"</TT>

<P>As far as real data are concerned, among our examples we have run
the above example using a set of 2700 RDF data model triples that
correspond with the data available at the World Wide Web Consortium
technical reports page. This page presents the public documents the
consortium has published along with their authors, dates, and
URIs. Therefore, one can get a complete knowledge basis regarding
W3C's authors, that is flexible and elegantly extendable.

<H2>Related work</H2>

<P>The use of Web infrastructure to accommodate logic programs has
been suggested by (Sandevall, 1996) and (Loke &amp; Davidson,
1996). The latter approach suggests using familiar logic program
notation to place facts and queries on HTML pages. The embedded rules
also have the ability to refer to other HTML pages with other
predicates using a namespace mechanism. In this way, their evaluation
context increases over the amount of HTML pages they retrieve to find
facts that satisfy the queries.

<H2>Conclusions</H2>

<P>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses
the problem of querying RDF models and extending it with the ability
of expressing reasoning rules. The metalog model that we have sketched
is general enough to be of wide use, and powerful enough to fulfill
most of the generic user's needs.  Moreover, it is elegantly
integrated within the "big picture" of W3C's standards, with a
particular eye geared toward extendability and future improvements.
It tries to lower the "access level" to metadata and reasoning
management by using a top-level syntax using natural language,
enabling not only easy and fast writing of complex relationships, but
also an extremely high readability. Finally, it can be used even
without the logical extensions, just to provide a user-friendly
interface to RDF. Future work that we plan to do within W3C is the
deployment of a publicly accessible prototype of the system, so to
foster on a large scale use of structured metadata on the Web.

<H3>Appendix A - Query schema in RDF</H3>

<P>In the following, we provide (part of) the Metalog schema, to provide the
technically oriented reader with more inside on how the schema effectively
uses RDF schema facilities.
